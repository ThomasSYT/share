84	correct	In series, the 2 bulbs have to share one pathway, so the light is dim. In parallel each bulb has a direct path to the D-cell energy source so both bulbs shine brightly.	They are dim in a series because they have to share the electricity and there is only one pathway for the electricity. They are bright in a parallel circuit because there are 2 pathways for the electricity, so they do not have to share.
257	contradictory	A rock is made up of many substances which are minerals. A mineral is an earth material that is one substance - a mineral can not be broken down further.	A rock has one thing and a mineral has a lot of stuff in it.
23	incorrect	When the electricity is turned off, the magnetism stops and the machine drops the beam onto the delivery truck.	By switching the magnet poles.
510	incorrect	The string is tighter, so the pitch is higher. The string between the cup and the table is not longer.	Because it has less room to vibrate.
47	incorrect	To communicate the measurement to other people and have the people know exactly what is meant.	It is important because if someone else had something different then you will not get the same.
672	incorrect	In Group one, the veins of the leaves do not meet at the center vein. In Group 2, each pair of veins comes together at the center vein.	Because some are light and some are dark.
429	incorrect	The volume increases. The sound is louder.	The vibration gets harder.
114	incorrect	In series, the 2 bulbs have to share one pathway, so the light is dim. In parallel each bulb has a direct path to the D-cell energy source so both bulbs shine brightly.	Because it is touching the one with the most power and it keep some for itself.
641	incorrect	A paperclip is harder than a penny, so if a penny can scratch a mineral, a paperclip can also scratch the mineral.	Because a paperclip is harder than the washer and if the washer can scratch the mineral then the paperclip would scratch the minerals.
675	incorrect	In Group one, the veins of the leaves do not meet at the center vein. In Group 2, each pair of veins comes together at the center vein.	They are different because some of the edges on the leaves are rougher than the other edges.
389	correct	The volume increases. The sound is louder.	It make the sound louder.
289	incorrect	No. The temperature would be higher because the student's finger would make the temperature warmer. [Heat would transfer from the student's finger to the thermometer bulb.]	No, No because he keeps on touching the thermometer and will never be the same.
623	correct	A paperclip is harder than a penny, so if a penny can scratch a mineral, a paperclip can also scratch the mineral.	A paperclip is harder because we scratched the penny with the paperclip. The penny got a scratch.
399	correct	The volume increases. The sound is louder.	The volume of the rubber band get louder.
563	correct	The string is tighter, so the pitch is higher. The string between the cup and the table is not longer.	The pitch is higher because you are pulling the string harder so it is higher but if you pull the string looser you will get a lower sound.
486	contradictory	The string is tighter, so the pitch is higher. The string between the cup and the table is not longer.	It has more string to vibrate.
445	correct	As time increases, the size of the ice cube decreases.	It tells you the size of the ice cube and the time.
455	correct	As time increases, the size of the ice cube decreases.	As time goes on the size of ice cubes goes down.
458	contradictory	As time increases, the size of the ice cube decreases.	As time goes on the size of ice cube stays the same.
265	incorrect	A rock is made up of many substances which are minerals. A mineral is an earth material that is one substance - a mineral can not be broken down further.	Mineral is something in a rock a rock is a hard cement kind of.
279	correct	A rock is made up of many substances which are minerals. A mineral is an earth material that is one substance - a mineral can not be broken down further.	Rocks are made of minerals are made of only one ingredient.
33	incorrect	When the electricity is turned off, the magnetism stops and the machine drops the beam onto the delivery truck.	They would use a controller so that they let them go and drop them.
100	incorrect	In series, the 2 bulbs have to share one pathway, so the light is dim. In parallel each bulb has a direct path to the D-cell energy source so both bulbs shine brightly.	In the series circuit there is a disconnection in the wiring. In a parallel circuit the energy flows straight to the bulb, goes through and keeps going in a circuit.
488	correct	The string is tighter, so the pitch is higher. The string between the cup and the table is not longer.	Because the string is tighter so it makes a higher sound David.
384	correct	The volume increases. The sound is louder.	The sound gets louder.
97	incorrect	In series, the 2 bulbs have to share one pathway, so the light is dim. In parallel each bulb has a direct path to the D-cell energy source so both bulbs shine brightly.	Parallel is something that if one bulb goes out all the rest will keep on going. A series is something that if one light bulb goes out all do.
382	incorrect	The volume increases. The sound is louder.	A rhythm.
116	contradictory	In series, the 2 bulbs have to share one pathway, so the light is dim. In parallel each bulb has a direct path to the D-cell energy source so both bulbs shine brightly.	The bulbs are dim in a series circuit because one of the bulbs is taking all of the electricity. The bulbs are bright in the parallel circuit because they are sharing electricity.
324	correct	The volume increases. The sound is louder.	The rubber band will make a louder sound.
