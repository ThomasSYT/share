4075	incorrect	The main job of muscles is to move bones.	To help you move and let you lift up things.
3263	contradictory	Cold water is denser. Cold water sinks to the bottom of room temperature water. Hot water and less dense things float on room temperature water.	Hot. Hot water is denser than room temperature water because most of the hot water will go to the top of the cup.
4222	incorrect	Joe could practice responding to the starting gun to improve Joe's start time.	Joe can practice and practice.
3348	incorrect	Cold water is denser. Cold water sinks to the bottom of room temperature water. Hot water and less dense things float on room temperature water.	Cold. Because when you put the vial in cold water it went down.
4018	contradictory	No. Andrew changed 2 variables at the same time (amount of chicken feed and the amount of calcium) so Andrew can not know which variables made a difference.	No, No, because he did not test enough variables. He only used 2 groups with very different amount of daily care.
4001	contradictory	No. Andrew changed 2 variables at the same time (amount of chicken feed and the amount of calcium) so Andrew can not know which variables made a difference.	Because he experimented that more feed equals more calcium and more calcium equally more eggs.
1253	incorrect	The water on the floor had a much larger surface area. The water in the cup had a much smaller surface area.	When the water fell it moved around so it was thinner than the water in the cup it was so hot that heat made the water on the floor evaporated.
2414	correct	Oil is less dense than corn syrup.	The oil is less dense than the corn syrup.
3080	incorrect	The right hand is faster than the right foot because the foot is farther from the brain. Therefore the message to respond takes longer to reach the foot than the message takes to reach the hand.	It is a shorter distance to your hand than your foot.
344	correct	Disagree. Evaporation can occur at any temperature.	I disagree with Angie because it can still be cold.
2977	contradictory	The water froze. Water expands when water freezes so the ice needed more space.	This happened because the water that was high contracted to the bottom so it had no more room to fit the extra water so it cracked.
1539	incorrect	Surface tension causes the plain water to look like a bead.	Because plain water does not break surface tension.
636	correct	rotates. moves in all directions. moves up-and-down, back-and-forth, and side-to-side.	Rotates when you throw a ball.
1074	incorrect	Water contracts when the water is cooled.	Because it is getting cold inside but is going to go down.
1963	correct	The marble is on the bottom of the cup (under the water).	My evidence is the picture. When an object is denser than water, it shrinks. The picture showed that the marble sinks, so the marble is denser than the water.
2206	incorrect	Condensed water vapor from the air inside the car.	Mist.
244	contradictory	10 milliliters to 20 milliliters. The radishes did not grow at all in pots one and 5 so the range of tolerance is for pots 2, 3 and 4, which got 10 to 20 milliliters of water.	15 to 20 milliliters, I if you subtract 5 milliliters from 25 milliliters you get 20 milliliters and I get 15 milliliters as the optimum amount of water so I put 15 milliliters to 20 milliliters.
4037	contradictory	No. Andrew changed 2 variables at the same time (amount of chicken feed and the amount of calcium) so Andrew can not know which variables made a difference.	Yes, because he made the chicken laid eggs after 2 weeks.
2322	correct	The oil is less dense. The water is more dense.	Water is denser that oil.
995	correct	Container X has more surface area or more water exposed to the air so the water evaporated faster.	Because it has a bigger surface area so it will evaporate faster.
2388	correct	Oil is less dense than corn syrup.	Oil is less dense than corn syrup.
1213	incorrect	The water on the floor had a much larger surface area. The water in the cup had a much smaller surface area.	Because most of the water in the cup has cup for heated and custody but the water on the floor will be evaporate because they have not custody and heated things.
2060	correct	The marble is on the bottom of the cup (under the water).	The marble is denser because it sank to the bottom.
3135	correct	The right hand is faster than the right foot because the foot is farther from the brain. Therefore the message to respond takes longer to reach the foot than the message takes to reach the hand.	His right hand was faster than his right foot because the message coming from his brain and down his spinal cord took longer. Because his leg or foot is lower down.
3205	incorrect	The stimulus is seeing or hearing the cup fall.	Moving your hand and using your vision.
2328	correct	The oil is less dense. The water is more dense.	Oil is less dense than water.
4419	correct	Sam's stimulus was feeling (or seeing) the mosquito on Sam's arm.	Vision - seeing the mosquito.
1053	contradictory	Container X has more surface area or more water exposed to the air so the water evaporated faster.	Because there is a smaller surface of the water to evaporate.
3788	correct	Max's response was to run after the cat.	To chase the cat.
2937	incorrect	Rachael could put the unhatched eggs in a salt solution that is within the range of tolerance.	She can hold experiments. She could look at past experiments.
2185	incorrect	Condensed water vapor from the air inside the car.	The fog is called condensation.
1465	incorrect	Surface tension causes the plain water to look like a bead.	The plain water can stick together much better because nothing is breaking it up.
3884	incorrect	Sam's response was to slap the mosquito.	It was sight.
2492	incorrect	The windows were cooler than the water vapor in the air, causing the vapor to condense.	The heat inside and the cold outside.
3354	incorrect	Cold water is denser. Cold water sinks to the bottom of room temperature water. Hot water and less dense things float on room temperature water.	Cold. Because cold water is denser.
