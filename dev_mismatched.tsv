No, Well, he did do a good job controlling the variables, but he needs to control one chicken at a time to get better results.
1449	contradictory	The bone is triangular with a hole in the middle for the spinal cord.	Different from other bones, because it has a round shape.
1201	incorrect	The water on the floor had a much larger surface area. The water in the cup had a much smaller surface area.	Because of the opening on the floor it had nothing around it and the cup water it did not have as big as an opening.
2772	incorrect	The human skeleton can bend because the skeleton is articulated (has joints).	A hinge allows you to bend.
2866	incorrect	Rachael could put the unhatched eggs in a salt solution that is within the range of tolerance.	By doing an experiment.
2526	incorrect	The windows were cooler than the water vapor in the air, causing the vapor to condense.	No answer.
2420	correct	Oil is less dense than corn syrup.	The corn syrup is denser than the oil.
426	incorrect	Expand the drop. Tilt the notebook.	Second you get a dropper and drag the bead down.
3126	incorrect	The right hand is faster than the right foot because the foot is farther from the brain. Therefore the message to respond takes longer to reach the foot than the message takes to reach the hand.	It was probably easier to move his hand because he probably uses his hand move than his foot.
1979	correct	The marble is on the bottom of the cup (under the water).	The marble sinks when it is more dense.
3766	correct	Max's response was to run after the cat.	Running after the cat.
2862	incorrect	Rachael could put the unhatched eggs in a salt solution that is within the range of tolerance.	She could put 10 spoons of salt in a cup.
4169	correct	Joe could practice responding to the starting gun to improve Joe's start time.	Joe could practice on that specific thing so he will get better.
1252	incorrect	The water on the floor had a much larger surface area. The water in the cup had a much smaller surface area.	Because of surface area the larger the surface area the more evaporation.
2173	incorrect	Condensed water vapor from the air inside the car.	The fog is condensation.
4449	correct	Sam's stimulus was feeling (or seeing) the mosquito on Sam's arm.	The stimulus was feel the mosquito land on him.
1254	incorrect	The water on the floor had a much larger surface area. The water in the cup had a much smaller surface area.	Probably because the water left in the cup was ice.
3300	correct	Cold water is denser. Cold water sinks to the bottom of room temperature water. Hot water and less dense things float on room temperature water.	Cold. Because cold water stays at the bottom.
4377	incorrect	Sam's stimulus was feeling (or seeing) the mosquito on Sam's arm.	Sam jump up because the soda could of gone on her.
1113	correct	Water contracts when the water is cooled.	Because cold water is denser than hot and it contracts.
4278	correct	The level went up when the water froze because water expands when water freezes.	When water freezes it expands therefore making the water level expand.
408	correct	Expand the drop. Tilt the notebook.	He could put a book or 2 under to make it go down.
2266	correct	The oil is less dense. The water is more dense.	Oil is less dense than water and it floats to the top.
4499	incorrect	The mangrove tree would probably die or the tree would not grow well because the tree needs a saltwater environment. Water without salt is outside of the tree's range of tolerance for salt.	Maybe it would grow slower because of the type of water it was moved to. Or maybe the tree would just die.
1468	incorrect	Surface tension causes the plain water to look like a bead.	It is called a dome and it forms a round like in the water.
3633	correct	Surface tension causes the drop to form a dome or bead shape.	The surface tension in the drop of water.
2446	correct	Oil is less dense than corn syrup.	The oil is less dense and the corn syrup is more dense.
1974	correct	The marble is on the bottom of the cup (under the water).	The marble sank.
4427	incorrect	Sam's stimulus was feeling (or seeing) the mosquito on Sam's arm.	The mosquito landing on Sam's arm.
3083	incorrect	The right hand is faster than the right foot because the foot is farther from the brain. Therefore the message to respond takes longer to reach the foot than the message takes to reach the hand.	Corey's hand moves faster than his foot because it takes less time for the brain to tell your arm to move. It takes longer for your brain to tell your leg to move.
4235	correct	Joe could practice responding to the starting gun to improve Joe's start time.	The way Joe could improve his response time is by practicing.
4298	correct	The level went up when the water froze because water expands when water freezes.	Because water expands when you freeze the water and the water goes up.
309	correct	Disagree. Evaporation can occur at any temperature.	I disagree because it does not only happen when water is heated.
1378	incorrect	The bone is triangular with a hole in the middle for the spinal cord.	Because it has a circle and then the bumpy part In the back.
4239	incorrect	Joe could practice responding to the starting gun to improve Joe's start time.	Joe can improve his start by practicing.
1198	incorrect	The water on the floor had a much larger surface area. The water in the cup had a much smaller surface area.	Because it was probably hot and it all evaporated and the water in the cup was probably cold.
2298	contradictory	The oil is less dense. The water is more dense.	The oil is more dense.
3724	incorrect	The bone is thin and curved.	That the bone came from a cow.
