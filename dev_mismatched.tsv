87	incorrect	X. When equal amounts of 2 solutions are compared, the solution that is more concentrated will have the greater mass (weigh more). 50 milliliters of X has a greater mass than 50 milliliters of Y, so X must be more concentrated.	X, because cup x has more stuff in it than cup y. cup y could still hold more.
289	incorrect	The launch position (line on the playground) is the variable that is controlled.	The same spot to throw the ball.
85	contradictory	X. When equal amounts of 2 solutions are compared, the solution that is more concentrated will have the greater mass (weigh more). 50 milliliters of X has a greater mass than 50 milliliters of Y, so X must be more concentrated.	Y, I think y because x just because it is heavier does not mean that that is more concentrated. I think it means it is less concentrated because there is more room the more water the more room.

That they both painted black on the inside in the bottom and filled the top with liters of water. And the heaters will set the sun.
205	correct	The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.	The solid stays because it is bigger than the holes in filter and stay in the filter.
359	contradictory	Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.	No because one has 100 milliliters of water and the other has 250 milliliters of water.
64	contradictory	The motor will continue to run because the motor still has a pathway to the D-cell.	The motor will burn out also.
121	incorrect	Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.	Yes. Yes, it would because since she put them both in the sun and stuck a thermometer in both then she will know which box will heat up faster, and she will see if her prediction is correct.
254	incorrect	The fizzing indicates a gas, a new material, is produced. When a new material is produced, a chemical reaction has occurred.	The bubbles occurred because it was gas.

377	correct	The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.	Because the triangles and containers are the same size and color they will both absorb the same amount of heat.
424	incorrect	40 meters. The change in elevation is 20 meters between A and B and 20 meters between B and C. So the change between A and C is 40 meters. 20 m plus 20 m equals 40 m.	Because the circle is gets bigger.
201	incorrect	When less than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the greater the mass of beans harvested. When more than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the less the mass of beans harvested.	The more you scoop you scoop, the higher, but if you get too deep the less you will get.
264	incorrect	The salt crystals are squares with Xs on top.	Salt crystals are small and white.
381	correct	Darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors. The dark green sheeting is the darkest color available so she should use the green sheeting.	I chose this answer because dark green is a darker color and would heat faster.
443	correct	The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.	Because the salt was a smaller particle than the sand.
203	incorrect	When less than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the greater the mass of beans harvested. When more than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the less the mass of beans harvested.	Too little scoops of fertilizer is too less but if you put too much it will weigh less as well. But if you put in not too much or not less is good.
172	correct	If the string is shorter, the pitch will be higher. If the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	The short string has a higher pitch sound.
14	incorrect	In the afternoon, shadows point east because the Sun is in the west. So the west side is opposite of the shadows.	Because I remember a compass rose and west is on the left side.
503	correct	C. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. Pan C has the most dark surface area so C would heat up the fastest and have the highest temperature.	C. Pan C held the hottest water because pan C has a lot of black in it and black absorbs heat. Pan A and B have barely any black. There is more water showing and I know that since water is a heat sink it takes longer to heat up.

The balance is tipped down on the ball side which means the ball weighs more than 30 grams. 40 grams is the only weight heavier than 30 grams.	I chose it because 20 grams plus 10 grams equals 30 grams and the ball is heavier that is why I chose it.
365	incorrect	There is 30 grams (20 grams plus 10 grams) in the right cup. The balance is tipped down on the ball side which means the ball weighs more than 30 grams. 40 grams is the only weight heavier than 30 grams.	I chose that answer because left side is heavy than the right side I think that is the answer.

373	incorrect	An experiment is controlled if only one variable is changed at a time.	You just work with the experiment and get it over with.
535	incorrect	She recommended the topographic map because the map shows the elevations along the trail. Pam would know where the trail was the steepest.	I think she would recommend this because a topographic map tells you more information for where you need to go.
358	incorrect	Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.	Yes, because if the same amount of solute and make a saturated solution the concentration would be the same if the solutions had the same volume.
91	contradictory	No, string is an insulator, so the pathway would not be completed.	Why it does work, because if the string is together the motor will run.
309	incorrect	Like poles repel and opposite poles attract.	They are not touching each other because the same poles are facing towards each other making them repel.
29	incorrect	The contour lines are closest together at Q.	I Think this because for Q the mountains steepness 5000 and Q is very close.
313	incorrect	A heat sink is any material that absorbs (a lot of) heat.	Something the heat sinks into.
52	incorrect	A solution was created when the eggshells disappeared (dissolved) and the mixture ended up as a clear liquid.	She make a solution because she put eggshells into the cup and covered.
406	correct	Bubbling means a gas has formed. Gas is a new material. A new material indicates a reaction.	Jorge knew that because it was bubbly and when it bubbly it means it is gas.
410	correct	Shadows change during the day because the Earth is turning. The Sun stays in one place.	Because only the earth move not the sun and if you are on the earth you could feel the sun beam on you all the time when you are outside.
247	incorrect	All variables except the girl need to be held constant (controlled). The girls all need to throw the same ball and use the same launch technique.	Have the ball the same.
413	incorrect	So people know exactly what the measurement means. A standard is necessary so everyone measures using the same unit and everyone gets the same measurement.	If you have a standard measurement you can get the correct answer and you do not have the wrong answer.
233	incorrect	There is a complete circuit connecting the motor to the D-cell battery.	Because Right is to turn off and Left is to turn on.
354	incorrect	During a flood there is more water in the creek and the water flows faster.	The water flow would change because if it floods it would overflow start a new and wider channel.
322	correct	A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.	If the water source has a bigger hole it would let out more water at one time, more water more erosion. If we make a steeper slope the water will have more momentum making it stronger to carry more earth materials.
364	incorrect	There is 30 grams (20 grams plus 10 grams) in the right cup. The balance is tipped down on the ball side which means the ball weighs more than 30 grams. 40 grams is the only weight heavier than 30 grams.	Because 10 grams plus 20 grams is 30 grams.
128	incorrect	Yes, aluminum foil is a metal and all metals conduct. The aluminum foil would complete the circuit.	Yes because it is aluminum.

299	incorrect	You can see how much time is taken for the earth materials to move.	The times, as well as things that have to do with the time, and observations you cannot draw.
122	correct	Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.	Yes. Yes because black absorbs the heat more than white.
461	incorrect	Crystals of different materials have different shapes. So the shape will help identify the material.	By comparing them to other solutions.
423	correct	Agree. Vibrations are movements. Vibrations produce sound.	I agree because it has to vibrate and vibrating is moving.
66	incorrect	The motor will continue to run because the motor still has a pathway to the D-cell.	The motor will keep running.
229	correct	The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.	The same because they are saturation and it cannot go any more.
173	incorrect	If the string is shorter, the pitch will be higher. If the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	The lower pitch make's the loudest noise.
195	contradictory	The bulb will light.	It might lose power.
56	correct	The saxophone has the longest and fattest tube.	Because the bigger it is the lower the sound.
477	correct	Fruitsnap contains little or no vitamin C so Fruitsnap does not change the color of the indophenol.	The indophenol did not change color because it does not have vitamin C in it.
223	incorrect	You can not tell because we do not know the strength of the magnets. If the magnets are weak, the second piece of foam might put too much distance between the 2 magnets for the interaction to hold the magnets in place. If the magnets are strong the magnets might stay in place.	I chose that answer because I am not sure.
363	correct	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Sammy - Because they are different things which make different sounds.
273	correct	The circuit is not complete. The electrical pathway is broken.	It does not make a complete circuit.
220	incorrect	You can not tell because we do not know the strength of the magnets. If the magnets are weak, the second piece of foam might put too much distance between the 2 magnets for the interaction to hold the magnets in place. If the magnets are strong the magnets might stay in place.	There has to be a more fatter thing.
294	correct	The mixtures are all clear.	Mixture one and 2 are clear.
452	correct	Many tiny bubbles will rise from the calcite when the calcite contacts the cold acid.	If you see bubbles coming from the rock it contains calcite.
206	correct	The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.	The solid is bigger than the holes in the filter.
0	incorrect	Elena should include a separate shelter for each lizard.	She should make sure they each have their own space.
487	incorrect	The root grows first so the root can take up water for the plant.	The root grew because it needs to help the plant stand up.
79	correct	Use a standard unit of mass like grams.	Use grams.
475	correct	The shorter the string is, the more the string swings in 15 seconds.  The longer the string is, the less the string swings in 15 seconds.	If the string is short it has more swings but if it is long it has less swings.
81	incorrect	In the morning the Sun is in the east so shadows point west. In the afternoon the Sun is in the west so shadows point east.	The sun rises in the east and it sets in the west, so the school bus must be facing east so that is why.
163	correct	Rub the minerals together and see which one scratches the other.	Rub them together and see if one scratches the other!
511	incorrect	The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.	Solution B is just double solution A.
226	correct	If the effort is applied farther from the fulcrum, less effort will lift the load.	The farther the effort is applied from the fulcrum the effort decreases.
307	correct	The elytra are used to make sounds.	The beetle can rub its elytra making noises in order to communicate.
517	incorrect	The crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals.	Because the minerals on the top look just the same as alum on the bottom.
442	incorrect	The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.	The salt is a smaller grain. The sand is more chunky and thicker so it not easy for it to go through.
506	incorrect	Overly Orange takes fewer drops to change the color of indophenol so Overly Orange has a higher concentration of vitamin C.	Yes, because if is changes color it has more vitamin C.
207	incorrect	The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.	Because you cannot handle the water. For example we cannot handle water on our hands but we can handle solid things.
494	contradictory	The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.	It is deposited where I indicated because the clay is the second heaviest so the river could not move it as far as the sand easily.
450	incorrect	The water was evaporated, leaving the salt.	We kept the salt in the vial and put the water in the Petri dish.
67	contradictory	The motor will continue to run because the motor still has a pathway to the D-cell.	The motor will stop working because it is in a series.
258	contradictory	No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.	She can too because it will be in a It will be a closed circuit.
126	incorrect	Seeing multiple colors would show that vinegar can separate the permanent ink.	By looking at the pigment and chromatography.
237	correct	A chemical reaction occurred. [The white solid is a precipitate (a new material) which indicates the reaction.]	It is a reaction.
99	incorrect	When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.	Because blue goes so high and red goes so low you cannot tell anything.
225	correct	If the effort is applied farther from the fulcrum, less effort will lift the load.	If the effort is farther from the fulcrum, it takes less effort to lift it.
386	correct	The seed coat protects the seed until the plant begins to grow.	It protects the cotyledon.
107	correct	Water heats up faster when covered.	That it maybe gets hotter than uncovered.
53	incorrect	A solution was created when the eggshells disappeared (dissolved) and the mixture ended up as a clear liquid.	Because when she found it was.
489	correct	A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.	A. The graph helped because dry soil will heat up faster than wet and A is higher so it would definitely be A.
401	incorrect	The circuit does not include both contact points on the bulb holder, so the electricity can not go through the bulb.	The wire on the negative side of the light needs to be hooked to the motor's clip it should look like this?
146	contradictory	Set up evaporation dishes. The water will go into the air (evaporate) and the solid will be left in the dish (crystallize).	He could put the solution through filter paper and separated the solute and the solvent.
389	correct	The rubber band vibrates.	Because it vibrates.
415	incorrect	So people know exactly what the measurement means. A standard is necessary so everyone measures using the same unit and everyone gets the same measurement.	Because it is a standard unit.
514	contradictory	When the string is tighter, the pitch will be higher.	The pitch will be lower.
202	correct	When less than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the greater the mass of beans harvested. When more than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the less the mass of beans harvested.	The relationship is that they had scoops of fertilizer numbered by 0, one, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and they have mass of beans numbered by 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, etcetera. Decimals going by 2's, so the relationship is that both scoops of fertilizer and mass of beans increases, and then decreases all together.
169	correct	The motor will run.	The motor will turn on.
533	incorrect	She recommended the topographic map because the map shows the elevations along the trail. Pam would know where the trail was the steepest.	Because you where how big or 4.
498	contradictory	Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.	I chose C because it has 8 spoons solute.
265	correct	The salt crystals are squares with Xs on top.	They are square with Xs in the middle.
350	incorrect	Compare prints to see if the patterns are the same.	Because they may be arches, whorl and loop.
51	incorrect	Earth materials erode and are carried by flowing water (a river). The earth materials form a delta when the materials are dropped off or deposited when the water stops flowing (at the mouth of a river).	Deltas form by the water wearing down the mouth and dragging it down.
80	incorrect	In the morning the Sun is in the east so shadows point west. In the afternoon the Sun is in the west so shadows point east.	Because the sun rounded around us that is why it is pointing the opposite direction.
200	contradictory	When less than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the greater the mass of beans harvested. When more than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the less the mass of beans harvested.	The more or less of fertilizer about the same mass it is.

271	incorrect	Susan should compare the amount of gas in each bag. The bag with the most gas contains the food with the most sugar.	Whichever one has the highest volume.
427	correct	40 meters. The change in elevation is 20 meters between A and B and 20 meters between B and C. So the change between A and C is 40 meters. 20 m plus 20 m equals 40 m.	40 meters, The contour elevation goes up by 20 meters and if you double 20 you get 40.
257	contradictory	No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.	Yes if it go in a circle.
534	correct	She recommended the topographic map because the map shows the elevations along the trail. Pam would know where the trail was the steepest.	She would recommend it because when they take the hike, they will know how steep the mountain is.
181	correct	The water splashed because the fork was vibrating. Vibrations make sounds.	Because the water splashed because of the vibrations moving.
105	correct	Water heats up faster when covered.	If the heater is covered the water is hotter faster.
112	incorrect	The sand particles are larger and settle first. The flour particles are smaller and therefore settle more slowly.	Because it will not get dry.
353	correct	During a flood there is more water in the creek and the water flows faster.	The water flows a lot faster.
392	incorrect	As time increases, the number of tree rings also increases.	The more tree rings the faster. The less, the slower.
325	correct	The mirror would complete the image of the object and make the object appear whole.	You would see the whole shape.
409	correct	Shadows change during the day because the Earth is turning. The Sun stays in one place.	Because although it looks like the sun moves, the earth is really moving making the way the sun shines on the earth different.
457	correct	Anna should compare the size of the grease spots. The sample with the larger grease spot has more fat.	A grease spot will appear whatever grease spot is bigger that food has more fat.
260	correct	If the key sticks, the key is iron; if the key does not stick the key is aluminum.	You will know because if it sticks it is iron if it does not it is aluminum.
522	correct	The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.	The more blocks he adds the more heavier it gets so the more heavier it is the more slow distance it will go.
275	correct	The circuit is not complete. The electrical pathway is broken.	The circuit is open.
319	incorrect	Put acid on a rock. If the acid fizzes, Phil would know that the rock has calcite.	If it fizzles it has calcite.
371	incorrect	The embryo contains the tiny leaves and root of the plant.	Protects stem and root.
27	contradictory	A. The water in Julie's heater got hotter faster (or had a greater temperature change in 20 minutes). The collector in heater A has the greater surface area so the water in A would get hotter faster than the water in B.	B. Because in B, it is long and it hold more heat.

191	correct	Jim would see a clear solution. 3 spoons of solid dissolves, so 2 spoons will dissolve.	Clear nothing on bottom because mixture 3 has clear and nothing on the bottom and it has 3 scoops.
399	correct	Fabric A is smoother and has a finer texture. Fabric B is rougher and has a coarser texture.	A is probably smoother than B.
524	incorrect	When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.	The magnet has more power so it is able to hold more.
282	incorrect	Topaz would be the hardest of the 4 minerals because none of the tools could scratch topaz and at least one tool could scratch each of the other minerals.	Topaz is harder than X, Y, Z.
291	incorrect	The launch position (line on the playground) is the variable that is controlled.	They all start in the line.
419	incorrect	The loops begin at opposite sides of the print.	They are going different directions.
281	correct	Topaz would be the hardest of the 4 minerals because none of the tools could scratch topaz and at least one tool could scratch each of the other minerals.	Topaz is harder than X, Y, and Z. Because it could not get scratched by the tools.
40	incorrect	The crystals have different shapes. Salt crystals are square with little Xs. The calcite crystals are shaped like needles (long and skinny).	Calcite crystals are flaky and salt crystals were not flaky. They are square instead.
118	incorrect	The marbles used by the 2 groups were probably different masses.	He could get a different apple.
250	correct	Different girls are throwing the balls. The girls use different launch techniques. Each girl uses a different type of ball.	Who got the running start and who did not and they had different balls to throw.
417	incorrect	The loops begin at opposite sides of the print.	On his A arch.
378	correct	The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.	I think the same because it is the same size, same shape, same color. It is just placed differently in the container which would not have an impact.
94	incorrect	A solution is a mixture formed when a solid dissolves in a liquid.	Different items.
296	incorrect	You can see how much time is taken for the earth materials to move.	What time the things happen.
11	incorrect	Diva needs to know how much gas pure sugar produced in order to decide whether the cookies are pure sugar. Diva needs to make a controlled experiment.	Because her dad told her that is pure sugar.
447	correct	Water will always flow downhill (mountain to valley).	I believe it flows in that direction because the earth water comes out of cracks in mountain a flow down the mountain and into river.
491	contradictory	A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.	B. I think dry soil goes down so it bring plants do not grow quickly so it goes down.
520	correct	The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.	The more blocks the less far it goes the less blocks the farther it goes.
156	correct	There is a complete circuit connecting the bulb to the D-cell battery.	That will happen because it is a complete circuit.
246	incorrect	All variables except the girl need to be held constant (controlled). The girls all need to throw the same ball and use the same launch technique.	They all had to bring the same kind of ball. And same weight.
25	correct	A. The water in Julie's heater got hotter faster (or had a greater temperature change in 20 minutes). The collector in heater A has the greater surface area so the water in A would get hotter faster than the water in B.	A. When a box has more black than the other it will heat up faster, and hotter.
481	incorrect	Measure out equal masses of walnuts and peanuts. Smash the samples uniformly in the same size area on brown paper. Wait the same time for each sample.	1. Anna can use a brown paper bag. 2. Spread the food on the brown paper bag. 3. Wait 2 days. 4. See which one has the most grease spots.
101	correct	When the string was shorter, the pitch was higher.	The pitch was a higher pitch.
145	correct	Set up evaporation dishes. The water will go into the air (evaporate) and the solid will be left in the dish (crystallize).	He could evaporate the water and then the solid will turn into crystals.
372	correct	An experiment is controlled if only one variable is changed at a time.	A controlled experiment is where you change a variable.
274	correct	The circuit is not complete. The electrical pathway is broken.	I chose this answer because they are missing a wire.
221	correct	You can not tell because we do not know the strength of the magnets. If the magnets are weak, the second piece of foam might put too much distance between the 2 magnets for the interaction to hold the magnets in place. If the magnets are strong the magnets might stay in place.	The magnets might be strong enough to get through the foam blocks or they are not strong enough to get through the foam blocks.
339	correct	The cotyledon provides food for the plant to begin growing.	Food supply.
368	incorrect	The embryo contains the tiny leaves and root of the plant.	The sprout that grows into a stem.
100	incorrect	When the string was shorter, the pitch was higher.	If you shorten the string it is louder.
421	contradictory	Agree. Vibrations are movements. Vibrations produce sound.	No! Because a TV makes sound and does not move.
208	incorrect	A car is made of a lot of iron or steel.	When you stop Do not you see a white line. I think this has a magnet under it.
320	incorrect	A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.	Because if you used a slope steeper it will destroy the earth material.
262	correct	If the key sticks, the key is iron; if the key does not stick the key is aluminum.	If it is iron it will stick to a magnet if it is aluminum it will not.
384	correct	The seed coat protects the seed until the plant begins to grow.	To protect it.
55	incorrect	A solution was created when the eggshells disappeared (dissolved) and the mixture ended up as a clear liquid.	Because something dissolved and stuff.
434	correct	As time increases, the speed of light stays the same (remains constant).	The speed of light does not change over time.
395	incorrect	As time increases, the number of tree rings also increases.	They look like it increases.
20	correct	A reaction was indicated by the bubbles of gas (a new material) being produced.	The bubbles.
227	contradictory	If the effort is applied farther from the fulcrum, less effort will lift the load.	If the effort is closer to the fulcrum then it is easier but if the effort is farther from the fulcrum then it is harder.
119	incorrect	The marbles used by the 2 groups were probably different masses.	They forgot to do some things before they balance.
103	correct	When the string was shorter, the pitch was higher.	The pitch will get higher.
396	contradictory	Fabric A is smoother and has a finer texture. Fabric B is rougher and has a coarser texture.	They are rough. A has bumpy dots. B has bumpy dots and lines.
369	incorrect	The embryo contains the tiny leaves and root of the plant.	The embryo is the part of the seed that grow into the root and then the stem.
149	incorrect	The harder coin will scratch the other.	Find the more harder metal and the rock and penny is harder and see it want is harder.
422	correct	Agree. Vibrations are movements. Vibrations produce sound.	I agree with Kate because a vibration has to move And in order for sound to be made it needs to vibrate.
431	incorrect	The cotyledon provides food for the plant until the plant can make food for itself.	Store food.
303	correct	So that people notice the sound.	So the cars and people would know that a is burning or is stuck in a small place so the peoples and cars could get out of the way for the fire engine could get through.
90	contradictory	No, string is an insulator, so the pathway would not be completed.	You can use string because it will hook and make it work.
147	contradictory	Set up evaporation dishes. The water will go into the air (evaporate) and the solid will be left in the dish (crystallize).	Filter the solution and the salt, dissolved salt, will stay on the filter and the water will just go back in the cup.
539	correct	When the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	It would be low pitch.
370	incorrect	The embryo contains the tiny leaves and root of the plant.	Food.
497	incorrect	Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.	Because cup A have more solute then cup one. But they have the same amount of water.
84	correct	X. When equal amounts of 2 solutions are compared, the solution that is more concentrated will have the greater mass (weigh more). 50 milliliters of X has a greater mass than 50 milliliters of Y, so X must be more concentrated.	X, cup x is a lot more concentrated because x is more heavy.
500	correct	C. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. Pan C has the most dark surface area so C would heat up the fastest and have the highest temperature.	C. Because black absorbs heat and C has more black area so I think it is C.
323	incorrect	A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.	Because more water would come out at once.
190	contradictory	Jim would see a clear solution. 3 spoons of solid dissolves, so 2 spoons will dissolve.	It would probably saturate.
348	correct	Compare prints to see if the patterns are the same.	Look really carefully at the paper and see if it is the same.
19	contradictory	No, Fruity cream cookies are not pure sugar. The cookies did not produce as much gas as was produced by the pure sugar.	Yes, it contain several grams of sugar.
111	contradictory	The brass ring would not stick to the nail because the ring is not iron. The nail is a temporary magnet, but brass cannot become a temporary magnet and thus does not stick to magnets.	Probably not it depends on how heavy it is and if it is made of iron.
238	incorrect	A chemical reaction occurred. [The white solid is a precipitate (a new material) which indicates the reaction.]	That indicates the 2 thing mixed together became a precipitate.
342	incorrect	A standard is used for comparison to determine how changing one variable changes the results.	You use a standard because you know it will be controlled if you do something random it might not work and that is not a controlled experiment.
538	contradictory	When the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	It would of got higher because it is a longer string so if she plucked it it still would be high.
284	correct	The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.	It is a parallel that is why just that one will go out.
433	incorrect	As time increases, the speed of light stays the same (remains constant).	This graph shows that the light was getting lighter and lighter by the minute.
525	incorrect	When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.	Because the magnetism is flowing.
310	incorrect	Like poles repel and opposite poles attract.	It is not touching because it is the other way around.
6	contradictory	Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.	No because all different solids have different solubility.
286	correct	The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.	It will happen because it is a parallel circuit.
278	incorrect	That circuit is the only circuit that uses all of the correct contact points.	The only circuit that will work is A.
466	correct	Wendy should hook one end of the wire to the negative side of a D-cell battery and the other end to the positive side of the D-cell battery.	She needs a battery onto then, attach the wire to the battery.
110	contradictory	The brass ring would not stick to the nail because the ring is not iron. The nail is a temporary magnet, but brass cannot become a temporary magnet and thus does not stick to magnets.	I think that the nail will fall. Because the brass ring is too much weight on the nail and magnet.
435	correct	As time increases, the speed of light stays the same (remains constant).	The light is staying the same and the time is increasing.
192	correct	The bulb will light.	The light bulb will turn on.
34	contradictory	The boat with 0 marbles is the standard in this experiment.	10 marbles and 5.8 amount the boat sank.
465	correct	Wendy should hook one end of the wire to the negative side of a D-cell battery and the other end to the positive side of the D-cell battery.	Connect the 2 end of the wires to the D-cell.
26	correct	A. The water in Julie's heater got hotter faster (or had a greater temperature change in 20 minutes). The collector in heater A has the greater surface area so the water in A would get hotter faster than the water in B.	A. Because Julie's had more black flooring. The more black flooring you get the hotter it gets. Julie's side of the chart had the highest temperature. So box A is hers.
189	incorrect	Jim would see a clear solution. 3 spoons of solid dissolves, so 2 spoons will dissolve.	He would observe nothing. It would be a solution. Because mixture one and 3 each have one scoop more or less and they are still solutions.
267	correct	The salt crystals are squares with Xs on top.	The salt crystals will look like small squares with Xs.
277	correct	That circuit is the only circuit that uses all of the correct contact points.	It is because the wire is touching the right part of the bulb. The electricity is flowing.
120	incorrect	Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.	Yes. Black is a hotter color than white.
68	incorrect	When the string was tighter, the pitch was higher.	You tighten the string you pull a string when the other hand tighten.
397	incorrect	Fabric A is smoother and has a finer texture. Fabric B is rougher and has a coarser texture.	A is like lines and B has squares and lines.
141	incorrect	20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.	I decided by looking at collector A's temperature at 10 minutes and doubled it.
356	contradictory	Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.	No because Mariella's is more concentrated because her's has less water so it is taste more sweeter or saltier.
244	correct	All variables except the girl need to be held constant (controlled). The girls all need to throw the same ball and use the same launch technique.	They all should stand and throw the same ball to have a controlled experiment.
143	incorrect	20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.	Because almost all in the 10 minute time zone are in 3 degree intervals.
253	correct	The fizzing indicates a gas, a new material, is produced. When a new material is produced, a chemical reaction has occurred.	Fizzing usually means bubbles. And bubbles mean there was gas formed which is a sign of a chemical reaction so yes.
324	incorrect	The mirror would complete the image of the object and make the object appear whole.	Is flat but when you write your letters backwards.
474	incorrect	The shorter the string is, the more the string swings in 15 seconds.  The longer the string is, the less the string swings in 15 seconds.	Well the longer the string the slower it swings so a 90 centimeters swinger will go very slow compared to a 19 centimeters swinger.
316	incorrect	Put acid on a rock. If the acid fizzes, Phil would know that the rock has calcite.	He would put vinegar on the rock get the strange then is quiet it and see if there is calcite.
98	contradictory	When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.	Because one is uncovered and one is covered. Also I think because they are now the same color.
480	correct	Measure out equal masses of walnuts and peanuts. Smash the samples uniformly in the same size area on brown paper. Wait the same time for each sample.	1. Get one ounce of walnuts and peanuts. 2. Smear each one on a circle of the same size on absorbent paper. 3. Put it flat on a tray. 4. Wait a couple of days. 5. Measure and take results.
150	incorrect	The harder coin will scratch the other.	If she can scratch a penny with her fingernail the nickel is harder.
249	incorrect	Different girls are throwing the balls. The girls use different launch techniques. Each girl uses a different type of ball.	They did not control the distance the ball went.
106	incorrect	Water heats up faster when covered.	The covered container can conceal heat.
387	correct	The seed coat protects the seed until the plant begins to grow.	To protect the seed.
436	incorrect	The crystals were square with Xs on the surface.	Well because we broke them apart.
