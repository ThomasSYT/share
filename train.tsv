2837	correct	Put acid on a rock. If the acid fizzes, Phil would know that the rock has calcite.	Phil should first put the rock in a bowl of vinegar. If it bubbles a lot it is probably calcite. Next if he is still not sure he should pour the rock and vinegar into a dish and let it evaporate. He should look for needle like markings.
1984	incorrect	You can not tell because we do not know the strength of the magnets. If the magnets are weak, the second piece of foam might put too much distance between the 2 magnets for the interaction to hold the magnets in place. If the magnets are strong the magnets might stay in place.	Because it is far away and I do not know how big the energy field is.
1756	incorrect	The bulb will light.	When the switch moves to the left, it will work.
1407	incorrect	There is a complete circuit connecting the bulb to the D-cell battery.	It will happen because it is in a running place.

1607	incorrect	The tree blocks the light from the Sun.	Because the sun is up.
1533	correct	If the string is shorter, the pitch will be higher. If the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	If the small one is high the big one is low that is what it is for the harp.
3032	contradictory	The cotyledon provides food for the plant to begin growing.	Gives you the fiber you need.
2357	incorrect	If the key sticks, the key is iron; if the key does not stick the key is aluminum.	By sticking the key to a magnet and try it out.
2107	incorrect	There is a complete circuit connecting the motor to the D-cell battery.	The switch is closer.
37	contradictory	Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.	No not all mixtures and solutions come out correct he needs to let it sit or he should let or he should let I stir it.
4689	incorrect	The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.	Because if you just took 50 milliliters of water out of each, they would be equal. I got this one wrong.
4377	correct	The shorter the string is, the more the string swings in 15 seconds.  The longer the string is, the less the string swings in 15 seconds.	If the string is longer it will go slower.
4458	incorrect	Measure out equal masses of walnuts and peanuts. Smash the samples uniformly in the same size area on brown paper. Wait the same time for each sample.	First you need 2 cups a little cube of a toy and a measurement and 3 brown paper with circular. And wait for 2 days.
3534	incorrect	The seed coat protects the seed until the plant begins to grow.	A hard outer covering to act protects the cotyledon.
4625	correct	C. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. Pan C has the most dark surface area so C would heat up the fastest and have the highest temperature.	C. Because it has more black in it that attracts the sun to make it hotter.
368	correct	The crystals have different shapes. Salt crystals are square with little Xs. The calcite crystals are shaped like needles (long and skinny).	The calcite crystals looked liked small white needles, the salt crystals were small white globs and squares with Xs and diamonds.
3299	incorrect	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Sammy - Because plastic, metal, and wood are different materials. And Nathaniel's code would be harder.
1939	correct	If the middle bulb burns out the other 2 bulbs will stay lit.	Only the middle bulb will go out.
2765	correct	Like poles repel and opposite poles attract.	The magnets are not touching because they cannot attract to each other if they are north to north or south to south.
16	incorrect	Elena should include a separate shelter for each lizard.	She would have to know the food the lizards want.
2151	correct	A chemical reaction occurred. [The white solid is a precipitate (a new material) which indicates the reaction.]	It indicates that it turned into a solution and mixture that got mixed then produced chemical also.

3365	incorrect	The embryo contains the tiny leaves and root of the plant.	The embryo is the root or stem.
136	contradictory	In the afternoon, shadows point east because the Sun is in the west. So the west side is opposite of the shadows.	When earth moves then the shadow will be in the west because by then the sun will be setting.
4519	incorrect	A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.	A. Because soil heats up faster.
4814	incorrect	The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.	The more blocks Don added the slower the toy truck will go.
1286	incorrect	Set up evaporation dishes. The water will go into the air (evaporate) and the solid will be left in the dish (crystallize).	Let it evaporate.
1598	incorrect	The tree blocks the light from the Sun.	Because it either has the light on it or some kind of light on it.
1339	incorrect	The harder coin will scratch the other.	A paperclip is harder.
3845	correct	So people know exactly what the measurement means. A standard is necessary so everyone measures using the same unit and everyone gets the same measurement.	So you get correct measurements.
2524	correct	Topaz would be the hardest of the 4 minerals because none of the tools could scratch topaz and at least one tool could scratch each of the other minerals.	Topaz is harder than X, Y, and Z because Topaz cannot be scratched by a fingernail, a penny, or a paperclip so it is the hardest.
1048	incorrect	The marbles used by the 2 groups were probably different masses.	Maybe the balance was a little off.
4022	contradictory	As time increases, the speed of light stays the same (remains constant).	As time goes on the speed of light goes faster.
1017	incorrect	The sand particles are larger and settle first. The flour particles are smaller and therefore settle more slowly.	It separates because of the water.
2702	correct	So that people notice the sound.	So people would move if it was an emergency.
1545	incorrect	If the string is shorter, the pitch will be higher. If the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	The siren makes it louder.
899	correct	When the string was shorter, the pitch was higher.	A bigger string makes a lower pitch and a little string would have a high pitch.
744	incorrect	In the morning the Sun is in the east so shadows point west. In the afternoon the Sun is in the west so shadows point east.	That happened because the earth moves which made the sun face the other way and made the sign face the other direction.
2653	correct	The mixtures are all clear.	When the solid disappears into the solvent.
1307	contradictory	Set up evaporation dishes. The water will go into the air (evaporate) and the solid will be left in the dish (crystallize).	Evaporate the solute. The water dissolves and the solute will turn into crystals.

1529	correct	The motor will run.	It will go on.
4582	correct	Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.	They are the same because once a solution is saturated it cannot go further.
3172	correct	During a flood there is more water in the creek and the water flows faster.	The water would flow much faster and rise above the marshes. During a normal day the water would not be moving very fast and if would not be over the marshes.
2952	incorrect	If gas (carbon dioxide) is produced, the food contains acid. If no gas is produced, the food does not contain acid.	Vitamin C or acid.
3200	contradictory	Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.	No, because the 100 milliliters of water is more concentrated because it has less solvent and 250 milliliters of water has more solvent.
1592	correct	The tree blocks the light from the Sun.	Because the sun is hitting at an object, and making a shadow.
1395	correct	There is a complete circuit connecting the bulb to the D-cell battery.	Because it makes a complete circuit.

4748	contradictory	When the string is tighter, the pitch will be higher.	The pitch will go low.
1102	correct	Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.	Yes. I know that black materials or plastic or just black will absorb the heat more and white reflects the heat or light back. Also black heats faster and more.
1090	correct	Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.	Yes. The black box will heat up faster than the white because the black box is darker than the white box so the white box reflects the heat and the black box collects the heat.
4444	incorrect	Measure out equal masses of walnuts and peanuts. Smash the samples uniformly in the same size area on brown paper. Wait the same time for each sample.	Anna can compare the fat in the walnuts and peanuts by doing the fat test.

2125	incorrect	A chemical reaction occurred. [The white solid is a precipitate (a new material) which indicates the reaction.]	A solution.
733	incorrect	In the morning the Sun is in the east so shadows point west. In the afternoon the Sun is in the west so shadows point east.	This happens because the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, therefore the sun's light is hitting the stop sign at different positions.
4836	incorrect	When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.	Kurt you were able to pick up that magnet because the energy of the first one was able to pick up more because of the energy.
2626	correct	The mixtures are all clear.	When the mixture is clear and no material is on the bottom.
4615	correct	C. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. Pan C has the most dark surface area so C would heat up the fastest and have the highest temperature.	C. The one with 3 disks could of got hot because it had more disks than A or B. Since it has more disks then it was the one that got the hottest because the sun heat got in it more than the other 2.
4165	correct	The water was evaporated, leaving the salt.	The salt dissolved and the water evaporated and the salt went to the bottom.
2666	incorrect	You can see how much time is taken for the earth materials to move.	You can get information and time of how fast where and how.

25	correct	Elena should include a separate shelter for each lizard.	Elena should put leaves, logs, and tree branches in the habitat.
4096	correct	The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.	The salt was small enough to go through the holes while the sand was too big to go through.
1919	correct	Earth materials settle out during deposition.	During deposition earth materials would get carried away to a new location.
3091	incorrect	The solid dissolves (seems to disappear) and the liquid remains clear.	When you cannot separate them with filters or screens.
1806	correct	When less than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the greater the mass of beans harvested. When more than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the less the mass of beans harvested.	It shows that if you put 0 fertilizer then it is 2.0. If you did one scoop she got 0.7 and if you did 2 you got 1.2 and if you did 3 you get 1.5 and 4 is 1.2 5 is 0.5 6 is 0.0.
2174	incorrect	The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.	The wires are not supposed to be connected like that.
4645	correct	C. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. Pan C has the most dark surface area so C would heat up the fastest and have the highest temperature.	C. The one with 3 is hotter because more black absorbs more heat.

1457	correct	Rub the minerals together and see which one scratches the other.	Rub them together and see if one scratches the other.
3535	incorrect	The seed coat protects the seed until the plant begins to grow.	Protects the seed.
4568	incorrect	The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.	The clay is deposited where I indicated because the clay has the lesser mass so it is can be carried the farthest.
1431	incorrect	Rub the minerals together and see which one scratches the other.	A rock scratch.
3294	incorrect	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Sammy - Because they are all different kinds of material.
1025	incorrect	The sand particles are larger and settle first. The flour particles are smaller and therefore settle more slowly.	Because when the rock breaks. They break into pieces that land heavier from gets.
4304	correct	Wendy should hook one end of the wire to the negative side of a D-cell battery and the other end to the positive side of the D-cell battery.	Wendy should get a D-cell and hook it up to the insulated wire and get a switch and hook some wires up to that, then she should get little washers and put them somewhere. Then you have an electromagnet.
1437	incorrect	Rub the minerals together and see which one scratches the other.	Georgia could rub them together.
120	incorrect	In the afternoon, shadows point east because the Sun is in the west. So the west side is opposite of the shadows.	The direction of west is left that the west.
2180	incorrect	The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.	If you look very closely the positive to positive and negative to negative. Positive and positive do not go together.
2167	incorrect	The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.	One battery is the wrong way.
4269	incorrect	Crystals of different materials have different shapes. So the shape will help identify the material.	He could match the crystals with other crystals.
1849	correct	The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.	Because the solute in the saturated solution dissolved and were dispersed equally. The material that did not go through was too big to go through.
4634	contradictory	C. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. Pan C has the most dark surface area so C would heat up the fastest and have the highest temperature.	A. Water is a heat sink which slows down the absorption of the heat so the more water the less heat in the pan.
764	contradictory	X. When equal amounts of 2 solutions are compared, the solution that is more concentrated will have the greater mass (weigh more). 50 milliliters of X has a greater mass than 50 milliliters of Y, so X must be more concentrated.	Y, is more concentrated because cup x is on the floor and that is not good, right?
1770	correct	The harder mineral will leave a scratch on the less hard mineral. If the black mineral is harder, the brown mineral will have a scratch.	If she does scratch one on the other and one gets a mark that you can to rub off. Then you know the other one is harder.
1485	incorrect	Emily's crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals shown on the key.	I chose that answer because it looks the same like the drawing in the circle.
1622	incorrect	The water splashed because the fork was vibrating. Vibrations make sounds.	The vibration that the tuning fork makes.
389	incorrect	The crystals have different shapes. Salt crystals are square with little Xs. The calcite crystals are shaped like needles (long and skinny).	A crystal is signet, and has stuff in the middle. The calcite is clear smooth. Salt crystals look like something is dried up.
3914	correct	Agree. Vibrations are movements. Vibrations produce sound.	I agree with her because the object has to vibrate.
3267	correct	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Sammy - Sammy's method because if we use wood blocks of different sizes then some of the block could sound the same and wood, metal, plastic sound different.
1205	correct	Bill must have been using degrees Celsius if 28 is a warm temperature.	Celsius.
3621	incorrect	The rubber band vibrates.	Because if you pull it, it goes like that.
449	incorrect	Earth materials erode and are carried by flowing water (a river). The earth materials form a delta when the materials are dropped off or deposited when the water stops flowing (at the mouth of a river).	Deltas are form by erosion and deposition.
3343	incorrect	There is 30 grams (20 grams plus 10 grams) in the right cup. The balance is tipped down on the ball side which means the ball weighs more than 30 grams. 40 grams is the only weight heavier than 30 grams.	I chose this answer because in the mass has 20 and 10 grams and the equals 30 grams.
756	incorrect	X. When equal amounts of 2 solutions are compared, the solution that is more concentrated will have the greater mass (weigh more). 50 milliliters of X has a greater mass than 50 milliliters of Y, so X must be more concentrated.	X, x because it is heavier.
2835	correct	Put acid on a rock. If the acid fizzes, Phil would know that the rock has calcite.	He should put a mock rock in a cup of vinegar, and if there is bubbles there is calcite.
4501	incorrect	The root grows first so the root can take up water for the plant.	So it can keep growing so it will not.
806	correct	No, string is an insulator, so the pathway would not be completed.	No, because it needs a path of electricity. It would need a wire.
1290	incorrect	Set up evaporation dishes. The water will go into the air (evaporate) and the solid will be left in the dish (crystallize).	Jim could evaporate the solution. The water would go into the air and turn into a gas but the salt would stay behind.
717	incorrect	In the morning the Sun is in the east so shadows point west. In the afternoon the Sun is in the west so shadows point east.	The sun is in different places at different times.
4457	correct	Measure out equal masses of walnuts and peanuts. Smash the samples uniformly in the same size area on brown paper. Wait the same time for each sample.	First you must have the same mass. Then, you must smear them on the same type of brown paper, but spread evenly in the circle. Finally, you must wait the same amount of time.
3318	incorrect	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Sammy's - Because if you use wooden blocks, then it all sound the same and it is difficult to tell which is which.
2774	incorrect	Like poles repel and opposite poles attract.	Because the rings are magnets and they are facing each other on the same side.
4618	correct	C. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. Pan C has the most dark surface area so C would heat up the fastest and have the highest temperature.	C. I selected pan C because pan C got the most black disks so pan C absorbs more heat.
2120	incorrect	A chemical reaction occurred. [The white solid is a precipitate (a new material) which indicates the reaction.]	The chemical that saturated down there.
700	incorrect	Use a standard unit of mass like grams.	They should be with a balance.
3622	contradictory	The rubber band vibrates.	Because it snaps together.
4039	incorrect	The crystals were square with Xs on the surface.	You take a look through the magnifying glass.
735	incorrect	In the morning the Sun is in the east so shadows point west. In the afternoon the Sun is in the west so shadows point east.	This happens because of the earth, it rotates around the sun which of course the shadows will move, also the sun rises in the east and sets on the west.
825	incorrect	A solution is a mixture formed when a solid dissolves in a liquid.	A solution is different because a solution is a mixture of a solid material and a liquid.
2922	incorrect	The mirror would complete the image of the object and make the object appear whole.	It will see like a pattern or you can see more and more.
864	correct	When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.	It will not be useful, because blue is covered and the heat will be trap and red is not. So all the heat will escape from the red uncover. The red uncover will heat up slow. But blue will heat up fast.
4282	correct	Crystals of different materials have different shapes. So the shape will help identify the material.	He can look at them really hard and compare them with others.
4708	contradictory	The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.	Solution would need to be doubled.
714	incorrect	In the morning the Sun is in the east so shadows point west. In the afternoon the Sun is in the west so shadows point east.	Since the earth spins, the sun twirls around us. In the morning it was hitting the bus sign in the back. Then later the shadow seems to have moved. It is because of the position of the sun.
1865	correct	A car is made of a lot of iron or steel.	The car is made of iron or steel.
3927	correct	Agree. Vibrations are movements. Vibrations produce sound.	Yes I do agree. Because an object has to move to make vibration which makes sound.
4905	incorrect	She recommended the topographic map because the map shows the elevations along the trail. Pam would know where the trail was the steepest.	Because it has more and more direction to go.
1358	correct	You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.	It has direction advantage it can go up and down.
3930	correct	40 meters. The change in elevation is 20 meters between A and B and 20 meters between B and C. So the change between A and C is 40 meters. 20 m plus 20 m equals 40 m.	40, Because between each is 20 and if you times 20 twice you will get 40.
1612	incorrect	The tree blocks the light from the Sun.	It has a shadow because the tree is blocking the light from getting away.
3177	incorrect	During a flood there is more water in the creek and the water flows faster.	In a flood the water would be moving stronger and faster than usual.
1621	incorrect	The water splashed because the fork was vibrating. Vibrations make sounds.	Because if it splashes it is vibrating so she knows now.
1923	incorrect	Earth materials settle out during deposition.	They are dark in new places.
2304	correct	No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.	No. The switch can only be hooked on one side at one time, unless you scooted the wires to the middle and hooked them up together.
4713	contradictory	The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.	I chose that one because in bottle B they took 50 milliliters but in it they put 4 spoons.
3892	incorrect	The loops begin at opposite sides of the print.	On the first one the middle is light and the second one is dark in the middle.
3609	contradictory	The rubber band vibrates.	When you pull it and it hits the other part.
3957	correct	40 meters. The change in elevation is 20 meters between A and B and 20 meters between B and C. So the change between A and C is 40 meters. 20 m plus 20 m equals 40 m.	40 meters, It is counting by 20's, 0, 20, 40, 60.
4605	incorrect	Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.	Both have the same because they have the same milliliters of water and they are both the same.
3234	incorrect	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Sammy - Sammy it would be easier because plastic is difference to wood.
1287	incorrect	Set up evaporation dishes. The water will go into the air (evaporate) and the solid will be left in the dish (crystallize).	Get a filter paper and pour the dissolve mixture and the solid will stay in the filter.
3895	contradictory	Agree. Vibrations are movements. Vibrations produce sound.	No because it is not true you do not have to move a bottle to make a sound.
2272	incorrect	The fizzing indicates a gas, a new material, is produced. When a new material is produced, a chemical reaction has occurred.	Because the bubble makes the solution or mixture different.
763	contradictory	X. When equal amounts of 2 solutions are compared, the solution that is more concentrated will have the greater mass (weigh more). 50 milliliters of X has a greater mass than 50 milliliters of Y, so X must be more concentrated.	X, It is lighter.
4919	correct	She recommended the topographic map because the map shows the elevations along the trail. Pam would know where the trail was the steepest.	It shows the contour lines so they will know how steep the trail is. Also they will recognize the shape of the land.
4380	incorrect	The shorter the string is, the more the string swings in 15 seconds.  The longer the string is, the less the string swings in 15 seconds.	That they both work together.
2860	incorrect	Put acid on a rock. If the acid fizzes, Phil would know that the rock has calcite.	He can do the vinegar test the evaporation test and the hardness test.
2588	correct	The launch position (line on the playground) is the variable that is controlled.	Throwing the ball from the same line.
3088	correct	The solid dissolves (seems to disappear) and the liquid remains clear.	When one seems to disappear because it has dissolved, and you can see through it.
2080	correct	The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.	Same they both are clear and there is material on bottom.
3221	contradictory	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Nathaniel - I picked Nathaniel because he has wood only. And Sammy has plastic metal and wood.
1926	correct	Earth materials settle out during deposition.	After deposition earth material is carried out to river banks. Deltas form and into the ocean.
1899	incorrect	A car is made of a lot of iron or steel.	The magnet can send a signal to the light because the magnet is controlling the light.
2097	correct	There is a complete circuit connecting the motor to the D-cell battery.	That will happen because the most energy will flow through the motor because the motor is on the right.
1222	correct	Lee should put one of the loose wires on one part of the object and the other loose wire on another part of the object and see if the object completes the circuit.	By putting the object on the 2 wires.
4183	incorrect	Many tiny bubbles will rise from the calcite when the calcite contacts the cold acid.	It would be mostly about minerals.
1163	contradictory	Yes, aluminum foil is a metal and all metals conduct. The aluminum foil would complete the circuit.	No you need a wire to make the connection.
1702	correct	Jim would see a clear solution. 3 spoons of solid dissolves, so 2 spoons will dissolve.	That the solid dissolved in the solute! That with one spoon. It is clear and with 3 spoons it is clear so the solid will dissolve in the solute!
3063	correct	A standard is used for comparison to determine how changing one variable changes the results.	When conducting a controlled experiment you use a standard because you compare your other results to see if it is accurate.
3727	incorrect	The circuit does not include both contact points on the bulb holder, so the electricity can not go through the bulb.	It going in a coil.
1687	incorrect	Jim would see a clear solution. 3 spoons of solid dissolves, so 2 spoons will dissolve.	There would be a clear liquid with no solid on the bottom.
376	correct	The crystals have different shapes. Salt crystals are square with little Xs. The calcite crystals are shaped like needles (long and skinny).	I can they are different because of their shape calcite crystals look like needles and salt had squares with Xs inside them.
237	correct	A. The water in Julie's heater got hotter faster (or had a greater temperature change in 20 minutes). The collector in heater A has the greater surface area so the water in A would get hotter faster than the water in B.	A. I picked A because the inside had more black space.

2993	correct	The food contains sugar.	It indicates that there is sugar in the food.
2557	incorrect	The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.	It happens because the 2 bulbs in the middle are connected together and they both are hooked to the wires.
4727	correct	When the string is tighter, the pitch will be higher.	It would make a higher pitch.
3215	contradictory	Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.	No, because Mariella's solution had more water.
1217	correct	Lee should put one of the loose wires on one part of the object and the other loose wire on another part of the object and see if the object completes the circuit.	Put the 2 wires that are off the board and put them to each end of the object. If the motor runs it is a conductor. If the motor does not run it is an insulator.

1720	incorrect	Jim would see a clear solution. 3 spoons of solid dissolves, so 2 spoons will dissolve.	There would be no material of bottom because mixtures does not have any material on bottom.
1369	incorrect	You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.	The disadvantage is distance in this one and in a single fixed it is that the load's weight stays the same the whole time.
3976	correct	The cotyledon provides food for the plant until the plant can make food for itself.	Stores food for it until it grows into a plant.
1762	correct	The harder mineral will leave a scratch on the less hard mineral. If the black mineral is harder, the brown mineral will have a scratch.	First you take the black mineral and rub it against the brown mineral. Then see if you can wipe off the mark and if you can the brown one is harder and if you cannot the black one is harder.
1138	correct	Seeing multiple colors would show that vinegar can separate the permanent ink.	Sarah will know if there is different colors and if the moves up.
1028	correct	The sand particles are larger and settle first. The flour particles are smaller and therefore settle more slowly.	Sand and flour separate because sand is heavier than flour.

When more than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the less the mass of beans harvested.	That if she puts 3 scoops the beans will have more mass and the more fertilizer the less mass it has.
89	correct	Diva needs to know how much gas pure sugar produced in order to decide whether the cookies are pure sugar. Diva needs to make a controlled experiment.	She needed to test pure sugar to find out if Fruity Cream Cookies are pure sugar.
3578	contradictory	The rubber band vibrates.	Because each side hits each other and make noise.
1255	correct	20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.	Because on 10 centimeters is 3 and on 30 centimeters is 9 so in the middle of it is 6.
2572	contradictory	The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.	Why, because it is a parallel circuit, and if one burns out they all burn out they all stay on.

3829	incorrect	So people know exactly what the measurement means. A standard is necessary so everyone measures using the same unit and everyone gets the same measurement.	So you can find the actual answer to a question that you have.
2885	incorrect	A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.	Why a bigger hole makes more erosion is because there is more water coming at once. The reason to make the slop steeper is so the water will go much faster.
4338	incorrect	2: Trace the features from the photograph onto the overlay grid. 4: Transfer the features to the matching squares on the smaller grid in your notebook.	2. Measure your photo and your notebook. 4. Then draw everything smaller onto your notebook paper.
3482	correct	Darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors. The dark green sheeting is the darkest color available so she should use the green sheeting.	Because dark green absorbs heat and yellow reflects heat.
3931	correct	40 meters. The change in elevation is 20 meters between A and B and 20 meters between B and C. So the change between A and C is 40 meters. 20 m plus 20 m equals 40 m.	40, C is next to B so you add 20 meters to the elevation contour line band A.

252	incorrect	The contour lines are closest together at Q.	Because the contour lines are closer than the others.
1481	incorrect	Emily's crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals shown on the key.	I chose that answer, because the picture look the same.
4391	correct	The shorter the string is, the more the string swings in 15 seconds.  The longer the string is, the less the string swings in 15 seconds.	The longer the less swings.
2173	correct	The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.	The motors shown at the right will not run because 2 negatives are connected.
2308	correct	No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.	No! The switch cannot be left and right at the same time.
3312	contradictory	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Nathaniel - I choose Nathaniel because his idea sounds better than Sammy's because using other kinds of block might be a bad idea.
635	correct	When the string was tighter, the pitch was higher.	When she make the the loose it get the sound lower.
4494	incorrect	The root grows first so the root can take up water for the plant.	It is because a root produces the plant.

607	correct	When the string was tighter, the pitch was higher.	It goes higher.
1284	incorrect	Set up evaporation dishes. The water will go into the air (evaporate) and the solid will be left in the dish (crystallize).	He could get a filter and pour the solution into to it with a cup under.
2127	contradictory	A chemical reaction occurred. [The white solid is a precipitate (a new material) which indicates the reaction.]	The material that you put in the water did not dissolve because it is too heavy.
2144	incorrect	A chemical reaction occurred. [The white solid is a precipitate (a new material) which indicates the reaction.]	That you have made a saturated solution.

207	correct	A reaction was indicated by the bubbles of gas (a new material) being produced.	Because the eggshells bubbled and a few days later the eggshells were gone.
1010	contradictory	The sand particles are larger and settle first. The flour particles are smaller and therefore settle more slowly.	The sand and flour separate because sand floats to the top and the flour stays on the bottom.
4601	contradictory	Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.	Because cup 2 has more salt, 8 spoons and because it has more material on the bottom.
3377	incorrect	The embryo contains the tiny leaves and root of the plant.	It helps the baby to eat food.
3501	incorrect	Darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors. The dark green sheeting is the darkest color available so she should use the green sheeting.	Because it is darker than yellow so it might attract to the sun to make the pool hotter.
950	incorrect	Water heats up faster when covered.	It tells me that if you use a cover the water will heat.
4757	incorrect	The crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals.	Because the crystals in the circle are the same as the crystals in the alum square.

4620	contradictory	C. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. Pan C has the most dark surface area so C would heat up the fastest and have the highest temperature.	A. Because B and C will take too long to heat up because there is more water in pan B and C.
927	correct	Water heats up faster when covered.	The covered one get hotter than the uncovered ones.
2296	incorrect	The fizzing indicates a gas, a new material, is produced. When a new material is produced, a chemical reaction has occurred.	Because it is bubbling and bubbling is a reaction when you mix stuff together and it bubbles.
42	contradictory	Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.	No because it has 2 different chemicals and it does not have the same solubilities.
2871	incorrect	A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.	The happen when you do the experiment.
2239	incorrect	Different girls are throwing the balls. The girls use different launch techniques. Each girl uses a different type of ball.	Throwing at the line and using the same ball.
4637	incorrect	C. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. Pan C has the most dark surface area so C would heat up the fastest and have the highest temperature.	C. Because the more black it is the more the black is absorbing and making the water the hottest.

1475	contradictory	Emily's crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals shown on the key.	Because that is the picture Emily drew. Crystals have different shapes.
3036	incorrect	The cotyledon provides food for the plant to begin growing.	Stores supply.
2550	correct	The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.	It will happen because it is a parallel circuit not a series.
1988	contradictory	You can not tell because we do not know the strength of the magnets. If the magnets are weak, the second piece of foam might put too much distance between the 2 magnets for the interaction to hold the magnets in place. If the magnets are strong the magnets might stay in place.	Because the magnets are too far away from each other and they fall.
2735	incorrect	The elytra are used to make sounds.	The jaw.
341	correct	Greta and Andre have different sized hands.	Because their hands were not the same size.

2899	correct	A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.	If the hole is bigger that will cause a flood. More water the more velocity causing more erosion. Also if make the slope steeper that will cause the velocity to be greater causing more erosion.
964	contradictory	The brass ring would not stick to the nail because the ring is not iron. The nail is a temporary magnet, but brass cannot become a temporary magnet and thus does not stick to magnets.	It might because of the force might be strong enough.
2870	incorrect	A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.	Because they both are stronger, flows harder and flows faster than the rest.
554	incorrect	Use a standard unit of measurement such as centimeters or meters.	They could buy a new rug and see if it fits.
3996	incorrect	The cotyledon provides food for the plant until the plant can make food for itself.	Holds seed coat.
3105	incorrect	The solid dissolves (seems to disappear) and the liquid remains clear.	You see how it mixes together and sometimes there are bubbles or wet.
2060	correct	The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.	They are the same because once a solution is saturated it is at its highest level of concentration.
3055	correct	A standard is used for comparison to determine how changing one variable changes the results.	You would use a standard to change any variables than just one variable that can be changed.
1132	incorrect	Seeing multiple colors would show that vinegar can separate the permanent ink.	The ink would separate from the paper.
1973	incorrect	If the middle bulb burns out the other 2 bulbs will stay lit.	No.
4897	incorrect	She recommended the topographic map because the map shows the elevations along the trail. Pam would know where the trail was the steepest.	It so it better to hike. A has more lines.
480	incorrect	A solution was created when the eggshells disappeared (dissolved) and the mixture ended up as a clear liquid.	Because a solution is when a solute and a solvent are mixed and she did that.
2010	correct	You can not tell because we do not know the strength of the magnets. If the magnets are weak, the second piece of foam might put too much distance between the 2 magnets for the interaction to hold the magnets in place. If the magnets are strong the magnets might stay in place.	I chose that answer because whether it sticks or not depends on how powerful the magnets are.
3705	incorrect	Fabric A is smoother and has a finer texture. Fabric B is rougher and has a coarser texture.	They are rubbed smooth and hard.
556	correct	Use a standard unit of measurement such as centimeters or meters.	By using a measuring tape.
1385	correct	You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.	You do not have a directional advantage.
3661	incorrect	As time increases, the number of tree rings also increases.	It shows you the number of tree rings and the time.
795	correct	No, string is an insulator, so the pathway would not be completed.	You cannot because a piece of string is not steel metal or iron so it cannot go through.
4900	incorrect	She recommended the topographic map because the map shows the elevations along the trail. Pam would know where the trail was the steepest.	Because it has more description.
1547	contradictory	If the string is shorter, the pitch will be higher. If the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	A shorter string makes a lower pitch and a longer string makes a higher pitch.
350	correct	Greta and Andre have different sized hands.	Because maybe the hand of Greta is too small. And Andre's hand is bigger.
1696	incorrect	Jim would see a clear solution. 3 spoons of solid dissolves, so 2 spoons will dissolve.	It will dissolve in the cup.
1810	correct	When less than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the greater the mass of beans harvested. When more than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the less the mass of beans harvested.	When Maya put too less fertilizer the beans weighed very little but when she started putting too much fertilizer the beans also started getting very light. They only time the beans were heavy was when she put 3 scoops. P S not too little not too much.
1992	contradictory	You can not tell because we do not know the strength of the magnets. If the magnets are weak, the second piece of foam might put too much distance between the 2 magnets for the interaction to hold the magnets in place. If the magnets are strong the magnets might stay in place.	The foam blocks are too thick, the magnetic force cannot go through.
946	correct	Water heats up faster when covered.	That it will heat up faster than uncovered would.
105	incorrect	In the afternoon, shadows point east because the Sun is in the west. So the west side is opposite of the shadows.	You would know by which way the shadow is pointing to.

2538	incorrect	Topaz would be the hardest of the 4 minerals because none of the tools could scratch topaz and at least one tool could scratch each of the other minerals.	I know because when you break a rock that is when you know it is hard or not hard.
879	correct	When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.	Because then you would not be controlling the variables.
3865	incorrect	The loops begin at opposite sides of the print.	Some are loop, arch, whorled.
3867	correct	The loops begin at opposite sides of the print.	One loop is on the left, the other loop is on the right.

205	incorrect	A reaction was indicated by the bubbles of gas (a new material) being produced.	Because she mix more there was fizz.
477	correct	A solution was created when the eggshells disappeared (dissolved) and the mixture ended up as a clear liquid.	She thinks she made a solution because the solute dissolved and the water is clear.
228	contradictory	A. The water in Julie's heater got hotter faster (or had a greater temperature change in 20 minutes). The collector in heater A has the greater surface area so the water in A would get hotter faster than the water in B.	B. Because B is more taller and it has a smaller top and it is not that extended like A. A is a transfer rate of heat. B preserves more solar energy.
644	correct	Solar water heaters with blue collectors heat up faster than solar water heaters with red collectors.	Blue versus are warmer than red versus.

2051	incorrect	The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.	It is the same because it has the same stuff at the bottom.
751	incorrect	X. When equal amounts of 2 solutions are compared, the solution that is more concentrated will have the greater mass (weigh more). 50 milliliters of X has a greater mass than 50 milliliters of Y, so X must be more concentrated.	X, I know because when something is more concentrated it is also heavier.

1026	incorrect	The sand particles are larger and settle first. The flour particles are smaller and therefore settle more slowly.	Because the flour was lighter than the sand.
973	correct	The brass ring would not stick to the nail because the ring is not iron. The nail is a temporary magnet, but brass cannot become a temporary magnet and thus does not stick to magnets.	I do not think it would stick because a brass ring is not made out of iron.
2494	correct	That circuit is the only circuit that uses all of the correct contact points.	Because D is the only circuit that is touching the black dot.
4281	correct	Crystals of different materials have different shapes. So the shape will help identify the material.	How the crystals were shaped and how they looked.
4148	incorrect	The water was evaporated, leaving the salt.	By slowly pouring it in a tray.
91	incorrect	Diva needs to know how much gas pure sugar produced in order to decide whether the cookies are pure sugar. Diva needs to make a controlled experiment.	To see which one has the more sugar to compare with the Fruity Cream cookies.
3192	contradictory	Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.	No, because there is less room for the solute to spread out in Mariella's solution. The material at the bottom is not part of the solution.

3313	incorrect	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Sammy's - Sammy's method is easier because plastic, metal, and wood sound different and Nathaniel's method is not that easy because she is using wood and sound the same.
2659	incorrect	You can see how much time is taken for the earth materials to move.	Whether it is slope or not.
2651	correct	The mixtures are all clear.	The mixtures are clear.
1052	incorrect	The marbles used by the 2 groups were probably different masses.	I think they did not zero it out on the balance beam.
1162	contradictory	Yes, aluminum foil is a metal and all metals conduct. The aluminum foil would complete the circuit.	No, if you use aluminum foil it still will not work.
3128	incorrect	Compare prints to see if the patterns are the same.	By comparing the 2 prints.
517	correct	The saxophone has the longest and fattest tube.	Because it is the biggest out of all the instruments.

23	correct	Elena should include a separate shelter for each lizard.	She should add another shelter.
4124	contradictory	Water will always flow downhill (mountain to valley).	I think it flows that way because rivers usually flow from valleys into mountains.
4103	incorrect	The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.	The salt became a part of the water so it dissolve in the water so the salt went with the water. But the sand did not dissolve in the water because it was so bulky.
999	correct	The sand particles are larger and settle first. The flour particles are smaller and therefore settle more slowly.	Because the sand is the heaviest and the sand would go to the bottom.
4416	correct	Fruitsnap contains little or no vitamin C so Fruitsnap does not change the color of the indophenol.	Because it probably had more sugar than vitamin C.
133	contradictory	In the afternoon, shadows point east because the Sun is in the west. So the west side is opposite of the shadows.	Because the drawing looked like the early morning of the day and I knew that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west.

1257	correct	20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.	Because 20 centimeters is in the middle 10 centimeters and 30 centimeters so I guessed in between.
4712	incorrect	The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.	Because there is more water and solute.
422	correct	If a part of the plant contains seeds, that part is the fruit.	Because inside the plant is a seed.
4853	incorrect	When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.	The magnet hook all of those paperclips together because the magnetic electricity travels through the paperclips.

2850	correct	Put acid on a rock. If the acid fizzes, Phil would know that the rock has calcite.	Put some vinegar in a vial but first put the rock inside then you will see bubbles going so so fast and you have to wait about 2 minutes and you will see it.
588	incorrect	The motor will continue to run because the motor still has a pathway to the D-cell.	The motor will still keep running.
1340	correct	The harder coin will scratch the other.	The one that is harder will scratch the less harder one.
1861	correct	The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.	The solid stays because its particle size was too large to go through the filter.

1148	correct	Yes, aluminum foil is a metal and all metals conduct. The aluminum foil would complete the circuit.	Yes because it has iron in it.
3335	incorrect	There is 30 grams (20 grams plus 10 grams) in the right cup. The balance is tipped down on the ball side which means the ball weighs more than 30 grams. 40 grams is the only weight heavier than 30 grams.	I got this answer because I counted 20 grams and 10 grams and it equaled 30 grams.
3801	incorrect	Shadows change during the day because the Earth is turning. The Sun stays in one place.	To get a small object and glue it to a flat surface. Then get outside put in the sun and record every hour until the sun goes down.
4549	incorrect	The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.	Because when we did our stream table experiment the water and clay mixed and the water and the clay flowed together.
2111	incorrect	There is a complete circuit connecting the motor to the D-cell battery.	Because the D-cell is not in the middle.
4286	incorrect	Wendy should hook one end of the wire to the negative side of a D-cell battery and the other end to the positive side of the D-cell battery.	She should hook the extra wire from the wrapping part and connect the wires to the switch and D-cell battery. Then stick a short wire to connect the D-cell and switch.
195	correct	A reaction was indicated by the bubbles of gas (a new material) being produced.	Because a reaction is where something combines and changes start which is a fizz or bubbles.
3210	contradictory	Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.	No, the one with 100 milliliters of water is more concentrated because the solid has less room.
2485	correct	That circuit is the only circuit that uses all of the correct contact points.	It is because it is the only one that allows the electricity to go in a complete circuit.
4885	correct	Both finger patterns are loops.	They both have loops.
4570	incorrect	The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.	The clay is where I indicated it because it is the one that gets pushed out the farthest.
1125	incorrect	Seeing multiple colors would show that vinegar can separate the permanent ink.	To do chromatography test.
3316	incorrect	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Sammy - Because when you drop something in the drop chamber it will be making sound.
3946	contradictory	40 meters. The change in elevation is 20 meters between A and B and 20 meters between B and C. So the change between A and C is 40 meters. 20 m plus 20 m equals 40 m.	30, because if you could change A on B so you A and C.
239	contradictory	A. The water in Julie's heater got hotter faster (or had a greater temperature change in 20 minutes). The collector in heater A has the greater surface area so the water in A would get hotter faster than the water in B.	A. Because the solar energy meets the collector sooner because it is shorter, so it heats up quicker.
4252	correct	Crystals of different materials have different shapes. So the shape will help identify the material.	You can tell by the way the crystals are shaped.
3513	incorrect	The seed coat protects the seed until the plant begins to grow.	The seed coat is for protection.

1411	incorrect	There is a complete circuit connecting the bulb to the D-cell battery.	Because left is to turn on and right is to turn off.
688	correct	Use a standard unit of mass like grams.	Always use grams to know who much it weighs.
1282	incorrect	20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.	I think the new temperature change would be 6 because I look at it it looks like it adding by 3 so that I would think would be the temperature change.
4425	correct	Fruitsnap contains little or no vitamin C so Fruitsnap does not change the color of the indophenol.	It did not change color because it has little or no vitamin C.
1855	incorrect	The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.	The solid stayed in because it was not as watery and it was bigger chucks. The liquid is watery and so it went through.
4006	incorrect	As time increases, the speed of light stays the same (remains constant).	It shows how fast the speed of light is.
3109	contradictory	The solid dissolves (seems to disappear) and the liquid remains clear.	Powder and water when they mix together. The water turn white, that how you tell or you look to the bottom.

4311	correct	Wendy should hook one end of the wire to the negative side of a D-cell battery and the other end to the positive side of the D-cell battery.	Connect it to a battery.
3197	contradictory	Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.	No. I think that Mariella's saturated solution is more concentrated because it has more solid.
2732	incorrect	The elytra are used to make sounds.	To protect.
4794	correct	The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.	The more blocks the shorter the distance traveled.

1791	correct	The harder mineral will leave a scratch on the less hard mineral. If the black mineral is harder, the brown mineral will have a scratch.	The harder mineral will leave a scratch on the less hard mineral.
1603	incorrect	The tree blocks the light from the Sun.	Because when a substance of an object blocks light, it creates a shadow.
1846	correct	The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.	The solid stays in the filter because the particles are too big to go through but dissolved can go through because the particles are small enough.
4180	incorrect	Many tiny bubbles will rise from the calcite when the calcite contacts the cold acid.	The vinegar would get all full with bubbles, and murky.
1272	correct	20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.	I added A and B 10 minutes and divided the sum by 2 and got the average.

3549	correct	The rubber band vibrates.	Because your making vibrations.
741	incorrect	In the morning the Sun is in the east so shadows point west. In the afternoon the Sun is in the west so shadows point east.	Well Betty the earth moves around the sun and that kind of has something to do with it like at different times shadows move to different directions.
2028	correct	If the effort is applied farther from the fulcrum, less effort will lift the load.	The farther the effort is from the fulcrum the less effort is needed.
1079	incorrect	Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.	Yes. Because the black one will get hotter than the white one.
956	correct	Water heats up faster when covered.	It tells me if you put a red uncovered it will not heat as much, If you put a red covered it will heat more than the red uncovered.
4154	correct	The water was evaporated, leaving the salt.	The water dried up and left the salt.
572	incorrect	The motor will continue to run because the motor still has a pathway to the D-cell.	It would still work.
1496	correct	The motor will run.	Only the motor will run.

3450	correct	The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.	I think the temperature will stay the same because they are the same shapes.
4964	contradictory	When the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	Still high.
495	correct	A solution was created when the eggshells disappeared (dissolved) and the mixture ended up as a clear liquid.	Because she mixed the vinegar with the eggshells and later bubbles started to show up then it cleared.
4514	incorrect	A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.	A. Because container A has a higher temperature and dry soil does not contain water so the temperature is going to be high.
3455	correct	The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.	It would be the same because they both have the same amount of water and they are the same size.

2567	contradictory	The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.	That happens because this is a series circuit. A series circuit means that if one bulb burns out they all do.
1294	incorrect	Set up evaporation dishes. The water will go into the air (evaporate) and the solid will be left in the dish (crystallize).	Evaporate the water so there is just the solid.
2065	correct	The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.	They are the same because when the solution is saturated it is at its highest point of concentration.
485	incorrect	A solution was created when the eggshells disappeared (dissolved) and the mixture ended up as a clear liquid.	I think Grace thinks she made a solution because she mixed eggshells and vinegar together.

3401	correct	An experiment is controlled if only one variable is changed at a time.	A experiment in which one variable is changed.
4115	incorrect	Water will always flow downhill (mountain to valley).	The river flows from biggest to smallest. That is why.
3407	correct	An experiment is controlled if only one variable is changed at a time.	When you only change one variable at a time.
1372	correct	You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.	The effort is going up which makes it harder.
2545	correct	Topaz would be the hardest of the 4 minerals because none of the tools could scratch topaz and at least one tool could scratch each of the other minerals.	Topaz is the hardest because none of them can scratch it but at least one them can scratch X, Y, Z.
602	incorrect	The motor will continue to run because the motor still has a pathway to the D-cell.	It will still run because it is not sharing a wire like a series does.
4831	correct	When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.	Because if the magnet touches the one paperclip became a temporary magnet and when another paperclip hooked that other paperclip worked like a magnet.
2018	incorrect	If the effort is applied farther from the fulcrum, less effort will lift the load.	Joule equals force times distance.

4236	incorrect	Anna should compare the size of the grease spots. The sample with the larger grease spot has more fat.	Peanut has more than walnut.
776	correct	X. When equal amounts of 2 solutions are compared, the solution that is more concentrated will have the greater mass (weigh more). 50 milliliters of X has a greater mass than 50 milliliters of Y, so X must be more concentrated.	X, cup x because it is more heavy.
2302	correct	No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.	No, because the switch can only complete one circuit at a time.
3849	incorrect	So people know exactly what the measurement means. A standard is necessary so everyone measures using the same unit and everyone gets the same measurement.	Because if you do not use it will not be right.
2088	contradictory	There is a complete circuit connecting the motor to the D-cell battery.	It is not complete.
2361	correct	If the key sticks, the key is iron; if the key does not stick the key is aluminum.	It will stick to iron and not aluminum.
1993	incorrect	You can not tell because we do not know the strength of the magnets. If the magnets are weak, the second piece of foam might put too much distance between the 2 magnets for the interaction to hold the magnets in place. If the magnets are strong the magnets might stay in place.	Magnets only have such a big magnetic field.
1220	correct	Lee should put one of the loose wires on one part of the object and the other loose wire on another part of the object and see if the object completes the circuit.	You can touch one wire on one end and the other on the other side to see if it will run or not.
1057	correct	The marbles used by the 2 groups were probably different masses.	Maybe because the marbles are different sizes.
2138	incorrect	A chemical reaction occurred. [The white solid is a precipitate (a new material) which indicates the reaction.]	It saturated in the cup.
1534	correct	If the string is shorter, the pitch will be higher. If the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	The short string, will make a high sound and a long string will make a low sound. The short string and the long string are different because they are high and low.
4136	incorrect	Water will always flow downhill (mountain to valley).	Because that is downhill.
84	correct	Diva needs to know how much gas pure sugar produced in order to decide whether the cookies are pure sugar. Diva needs to make a controlled experiment.	She needed to test the pure sugar because she needed a controlled variable because if she did not, she would not know how much sugar is in sugar and she cannot compare the cookies and the sugar.
780	correct	X. When equal amounts of 2 solutions are compared, the solution that is more concentrated will have the greater mass (weigh more). 50 milliliters of X has a greater mass than 50 milliliters of Y, so X must be more concentrated.	X, because x is on the bottom of the weighing thing while y is on the top.
1581	correct	The tree blocks the light from the Sun.	The tree has a shadow because the tree blocked the sun from hitting the ground.

1334	correct	The harder coin will scratch the other.	The nickel is the hardest because is you scratch it with a penny it will not scratch but the nickel could because it is so much.
3537	correct	The seed coat protects the seed until the plant begins to grow.	The seed coat protects the seed web germinating.
2450	correct	The circuit is not complete. The electrical pathway is broken.	It does not have the wire to make it a complete circuit.
3855	incorrect	So people know exactly what the measurement means. A standard is necessary so everyone measures using the same unit and everyone gets the same measurement.	So everybody get it right or get the same answer.
2344	contradictory	If the key sticks, the key is iron; if the key does not stick the key is aluminum.	Aluminum will stick to a magnet.
824	correct	A solution is a mixture formed when a solid dissolves in a liquid.	In a solution one of the materials dissolves and the mixture is see through.

3679	correct	As time increases, the number of tree rings also increases.	They are both are increasing.
3819	incorrect	Shadows change during the day because the Earth is turning. The Sun stays in one place.	Because you can see them better and you can mark down the spot your shadow was at.
1599	incorrect	The tree blocks the light from the Sun.	The tree in this picture has a shadow because the tree is something that can be reflected to the ground by the sun, and in this picture, the sun is out.
3496	incorrect	Darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors. The dark green sheeting is the darkest color available so she should use the green sheeting.	Dark green is a darker color than yellow, therefore it will heat hotter and faster.
4386	correct	The shorter the string is, the more the string swings in 15 seconds.  The longer the string is, the less the string swings in 15 seconds.	The bigger the length the slower it is the smaller the length is the faster.
3435	contradictory	The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.	The reason why I picked less than is because I think that Y is going to contain the different amount after 30 minutes.
3486	correct	Darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors. The dark green sheeting is the darkest color available so she should use the green sheeting.	I chose to put the green plastic because if the color is dark then the sun gets attracted to the dark color which makes it heat up faster.

1466	correct	Emily's crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals shown on the key.	I looked at the crystal shape key and it looks most like alum.
2838	incorrect	Put acid on a rock. If the acid fizzes, Phil would know that the rock has calcite.	Phil should find a rock he thinks has calcite, and put it in a vial with vinegar in it. Then after a while he should pour the vinegar into the shallow dish. After that Phil should let it evaporate. Then Phil should look at what is inside the dish. If it has long, white, needles, then there probably is calcite in that rock.
4302	correct	Wendy should hook one end of the wire to the negative side of a D-cell battery and the other end to the positive side of the D-cell battery.	Wendy can hook one side of the wire to a switch, and the other side of the wire to the negative side of the D-cell after that get another small wire and hook that to the positive side of the D-cell and to the top of the switch.
979	contradictory	The brass ring would not stick to the nail because the ring is not iron. The nail is a temporary magnet, but brass cannot become a temporary magnet and thus does not stick to magnets.	I think the nail would stick to it because the nail will still have the magnetic force.

2013	correct	If the effort is applied farther from the fulcrum, less effort will lift the load.	The farther away the effort is the easier it is to lift the load.
2425	correct	Susan should compare the amount of gas in each bag. The bag with the most gas contains the food with the most sugar.	She will know which one has the most sugar by measuring the volume and if the food has a lot of sugar. You will see it because it will have a lot of carbon dioxide in the bag.
463	correct	A solution was created when the eggshells disappeared (dissolved) and the mixture ended up as a clear liquid.	She made a solution because she said that the water was clear and that is a solution.
3833	incorrect	So people know exactly what the measurement means. A standard is necessary so everyone measures using the same unit and everyone gets the same measurement.	We use standard units because if somebody makes bottles of water the put at the bottom how many liters it is.
2798	correct	A heat sink is any material that absorbs (a lot of) heat.	A heat sink is an object that can attract heat.
2038	correct	If the effort is applied farther from the fulcrum, less effort will lift the load.	The farther away the effort is from the fulcrum the less effort it takes. The closer the effort is to the fulcrum the more effort it takes.
1383	incorrect	You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.	You have to use less effort.
2215	incorrect	All variables except the girl need to be held constant (controlled). The girls all need to throw the same ball and use the same launch technique.	Same ball and stand on the line.

1590	incorrect	The tree blocks the light from the Sun.	Because the sun is up.
1708	incorrect	Jim would see a clear solution. 3 spoons of solid dissolves, so 2 spoons will dissolve.	It would dissolve because 100 milliliters of water gives the solid more room to dissolve.
2542	incorrect	Topaz would be the hardest of the 4 minerals because none of the tools could scratch topaz and at least one tool could scratch each of the other minerals.	Topaz has to have X, Y, Z as minerals.
1936	correct	Earth materials settle out during deposition.	During deposition earth material is deposited it formed deltas, a canyon, and a channel.
202	correct	A reaction was indicated by the bubbles of gas (a new material) being produced.	A few bubbles came. Gas.
369	incorrect	The crystals have different shapes. Salt crystals are square with little Xs. The calcite crystals are shaped like needles (long and skinny).	Well the vinegar if you beating a rock it will store bowl.
4874	correct	Both finger patterns are loops.	They are both loops.
1328	contradictory	The harder coin will scratch the other.	It would tell her because she could scratch the penny on the nickel and the nickel on the penny and see which one is scratched.
40	correct	Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.	Yes it is possible both solubility's are correct different solubility's very possible because some substances are more able to dissolve in less space than others.
68	incorrect	Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.	Yes because silver nitrate might be heavier.
2136	incorrect	A chemical reaction occurred. [The white solid is a precipitate (a new material) which indicates the reaction.]	It indicates a precipitate.
1985	contradictory	You can not tell because we do not know the strength of the magnets. If the magnets are weak, the second piece of foam might put too much distance between the 2 magnets for the interaction to hold the magnets in place. If the magnets are strong the magnets might stay in place.	Because the 2 foam blocks are too thick.
2543	incorrect	Topaz would be the hardest of the 4 minerals because none of the tools could scratch topaz and at least one tool could scratch each of the other minerals.	Because it is harder.
4784	incorrect	The crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals.	Because I looked at the crystals and looked at the key and compared it. Then I saw a match.
4378	correct	The shorter the string is, the more the string swings in 15 seconds.  The longer the string is, the less the string swings in 15 seconds.	The shorter the string the more times it swings.
4428	correct	Fruitsnap contains little or no vitamin C so Fruitsnap does not change the color of the indophenol.	There is no vitamin C in the drink.
4554	correct	The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.	Clay is where I indicated it because clay is the lightest material so it travels the farthest.
3442	contradictory	The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.	Because I think it might be higher.
2509	correct	That circuit is the only circuit that uses all of the correct contact points.	Because the negative is connected to the black part and the positive side is attached to the shiny part.
1444	correct	Rub the minerals together and see which one scratches the other.	Georgia could rub them together.
58	incorrect	Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.	Yes because something else can have the exact same thing and it does not have to be like that.
2667	incorrect	You can see how much time is taken for the earth materials to move.	Clay sand pebbles.
3704	incorrect	Fabric A is smoother and has a finer texture. Fabric B is rougher and has a coarser texture.	The A one is kind of bluer and it must have been smooth because it does not have any bumps. B you could see it was bumpy.
2763	correct	The elytra are used to make sounds.	The elytra makes sounds. Example danger, Example did you have a good day.
2204	correct	All variables except the girl need to be held constant (controlled). The girls all need to throw the same ball and use the same launch technique.	Where they throw the ball, use the same ball, they all get a running start.
4619	incorrect	C. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. Pan C has the most dark surface area so C would heat up the fastest and have the highest temperature.	C. There is more black to attract the sun.
2352	incorrect	If the key sticks, the key is iron; if the key does not stick the key is aluminum.	If the key sticks.
1659	correct	If the motor runs, the object is a conductor.	If the motor comes on.
2176	contradictory	The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.	Because the motors do not have a minus side. They both have a positive side.
3291	incorrect	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Sammy - It is Sammy.
2477	correct	The circuit is not complete. The electrical pathway is broken.	It is not a complete circuit.
178	correct	A reaction was indicated by the bubbles of gas (a new material) being produced.	She made a reaction because it started to bubble after a while.
3590	correct	The rubber band vibrates.	Because the rubber band is vibrating.
1615	incorrect	The water splashed because the fork was vibrating. Vibrations make sounds.	Because if you bang it on the wood it starts to make a weird sound! But if you put it in water, you can see that it is moving because the water goes swash so you can see it move.
397	correct	If a part of the plant contains seeds, that part is the fruit.	If has seed, in it the do have seeds, in it.
2182	incorrect	The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.	Because one has the most power than the other one.
3570	correct	The rubber band vibrates.	Because it vibrates.
1820	incorrect	When less than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the greater the mass of beans harvested. When more than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the less the mass of beans harvested.	If there are the mass of the beans and the fertilizer they will be different.
798	incorrect	No, string is an insulator, so the pathway would not be completed.	No because the string had not metal or iron.
453	correct	Earth materials erode and are carried by flowing water (a river). The earth materials form a delta when the materials are dropped off or deposited when the water stops flowing (at the mouth of a river).	A delta forms whenever a river picks up dirt, sand and clay and carries them to the mouth of the river were it is weakened so it drops the materials and forms a delta.
738	correct	In the morning the Sun is in the east so shadows point west. In the afternoon the Sun is in the west so shadows point east.	This is happening because the sun rises in the east so in the morning the shadow will be in the west. The sun sets in the west so the shadows will be in the east.
4055	incorrect	The crystals were square with Xs on the surface.	Because salt is a crystal.
1741	correct	The bulb will light.	The light will run.
3981	incorrect	The cotyledon provides food for the plant until the plant can make food for itself.	The cotyledon stores the food.
4277	incorrect	Crystals of different materials have different shapes. So the shape will help identify the material.	You can use your own mixtures and see what it looks like.
718	contradictory	In the morning the Sun is in the east so shadows point west. In the afternoon the Sun is in the west so shadows point east.	This happens because in the morning the sun rises north that is why the bus points in the street. The bus points the opposite direction, because the sun sets west.
4968	correct	When the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	The pitch would be low.
2165	contradictory	The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.	They will not run because the electricity is going in a circle. And the electricity would be run in and out.
3885	incorrect	The loops begin at opposite sides of the print.	They one are in different directions.
3031	incorrect	The cotyledon provides food for the plant to begin growing.	Feed it.
3835	correct	So people know exactly what the measurement means. A standard is necessary so everyone measures using the same unit and everyone gets the same measurement.	I think because if we do not use a standard unit we would get the answer wrong.
4903	incorrect	She recommended the topographic map because the map shows the elevations along the trail. Pam would know where the trail was the steepest.	Because a topographic map shows you if a place is going to be steep it also shows you what other roads or rivers to take well in other words it gives you more detail.
4800	incorrect	The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.	The more blocks the harder the truck tries to go faster causing it to go slower.
4609	contradictory	Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.	The solutions both have the same amount of water, but not the same amount of clear material on the bottom. So cup one wins.
1323	incorrect	The harder coin will scratch the other.	If it makes a scratch or a little dent.
4284	correct	Wendy should hook one end of the wire to the negative side of a D-cell battery and the other end to the positive side of the D-cell battery.	She would put and back it to a D-cell.
2863	incorrect	Put acid on a rock. If the acid fizzes, Phil would know that the rock has calcite.	Put the rock in vinegar.
4394	correct	The shorter the string is, the more the string swings in 15 seconds.  The longer the string is, the less the string swings in 15 seconds.	The shorter the string the more swings the longer the string the less the swings.
4322	correct	Wendy should hook one end of the wire to the negative side of a D-cell battery and the other end to the positive side of the D-cell battery.	To complete the circuit she needs to connect both ends of the wire to both end of a D-cell. You can use a switch.
4811	incorrect	The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.	The number of blocks is measuring by meters.
3047	correct	A standard is used for comparison to determine how changing one variable changes the results.	So that you can see the results of an experiment before a variable is changed so you can compare.
4841	incorrect	When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.	He is able to by letting the force go through the paperclips and making them all attract not repel because hand makes a repel and that is a magnetism of science.
4525	contradictory	A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.	B. The graph helped me because dry soil is not a heat sink like water so it does not absorb the heat as fast.
1987	correct	You can not tell because we do not know the strength of the magnets. If the magnets are weak, the second piece of foam might put too much distance between the 2 magnets for the interaction to hold the magnets in place. If the magnets are strong the magnets might stay in place.	It depends on how big or thick the sponge is. It also depends on how strong the magnets are.
4556	incorrect	The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.	The clay is deposited where I indicated because the river has brought the clay in the lake.
1089	correct	Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.	Yes. Because anything black will absorb the heat, and the heat will make the box hotter every 5 minutes that she checks. But if she was talking about the white box the answer would be no because white does not absorb heat like black does, it just makes it even cooler than hotter. So the answer is Yes!
1786	correct	The harder mineral will leave a scratch on the less hard mineral. If the black mineral is harder, the brown mineral will have a scratch.	If you see a mark that does not mean it is the softest. If it is pushed in that means it is the softest and the harder one there is nothing.
621	incorrect	When the string was tighter, the pitch was higher.	When you tighten it up it would sound different.
1821	contradictory	When less than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the greater the mass of beans harvested. When more than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the less the mass of beans harvested.	The mass of beans harvested is getting bigger and higher.
2183	incorrect	The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.	Because one D-cell has to be between the motors.
1905	contradictory	Earth materials settle out during deposition.	The materials like burst away.
1267	incorrect	20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.	Because I looked at my graph to tell what it would be.
183	correct	A reaction was indicated by the bubbles of gas (a new material) being produced.	Because there are bubbles and the shells just disappeared.
359	correct	The crystals have different shapes. Salt crystals are square with little Xs. The calcite crystals are shaped like needles (long and skinny).	The calcite crystals were lines and the salt crystals were pyramids and squares.
3654	incorrect	As time increases, the number of tree rings also increases.	That there is a lot of rings and a lot of time.
4083	incorrect	The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.	Because he put water in it so the salt dissolved with the water and ran right through.
2829	incorrect	A heat sink is any material that absorbs (a lot of) heat.	A heat sink is something that takes water to absorb.
3044	incorrect	The cotyledon provides food for the plant to begin growing.	The baby inside the seed.
3124	incorrect	Compare prints to see if the patterns are the same.	The carbon printings will look the same.

2603	correct	The launch position (line on the playground) is the variable that is controlled.	They controlled the line.
1311	correct	Set up evaporation dishes. The water will go into the air (evaporate) and the solid will be left in the dish (crystallize).	Jim could put the solution in an evaporation dish and the solid will be the crystals and the water will evaporate.
1410	correct	There is a complete circuit connecting the bulb to the D-cell battery.	That happens because if you move it to the left she just closed that circuit.
2078	incorrect	The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.	One, 2, 3 they all are clear with no material on the bottom.
859	incorrect	When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.	Because they are different colors.
2246	incorrect	Different girls are throwing the balls. The girls use different launch techniques. Each girl uses a different type of ball.	What kind of ball you use, and how you throw it.
1560	correct	If the string is shorter, the pitch will be higher. If the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	The shorter strings make a higher sound because the vibrations do not travel as long.
1120	contradictory	Seeing multiple colors would show that vinegar can separate the permanent ink.	She will not because the ink will not separate.
3300	contradictory	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Nathaniel - Because they are all different shapes and sizes so they are easier to discriminate.
745	incorrect	In the morning the Sun is in the east so shadows point west. In the afternoon the Sun is in the west so shadows point east.	Because the sun rises in the east and sets on the west. So in the morning the shadows will be facing one direction and on the afternoon it will be facing the other way.
1531	correct	If the string is shorter, the pitch will be higher. If the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	It is different because the little string makes a height sound.
638	incorrect	When the string was tighter, the pitch was higher.	By moving her finger.
3350	incorrect	There is 30 grams (20 grams plus 10 grams) in the right cup. The balance is tipped down on the ball side which means the ball weighs more than 30 grams. 40 grams is the only weight heavier than 30 grams.	Because I carried a ball before and it felt like to me it is 30 grams.
4128	incorrect	Water will always flow downhill (mountain to valley).	It flows in that direction because the mountain usually carries the water down the side of the mountain.
2394	correct	The salt crystals are squares with Xs on top.	They are squares with Xs in them.
4764	incorrect	The crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals.	It is the same crystals.

3607	correct	The rubber band vibrates.	Because it vibrates.
326	incorrect	Greta and Andre have different sized hands.	It was not a standard unit of measurement.
4041	incorrect	The crystals were square with Xs on the surface.	We looked at a piece of paper and one of the pictures looked like the crystals.
4009	correct	As time increases, the speed of light stays the same (remains constant).	It tells me that the speed of light goes straight.
447	incorrect	Earth materials erode and are carried by flowing water (a river). The earth materials form a delta when the materials are dropped off or deposited when the water stops flowing (at the mouth of a river).	As the water from the mountain comes and invades the place, it starts the canyon then it meanders around until it comes to another larger body of water and the delta is the end of the lake and beginning of the lake.
4483	incorrect	The root grows first so the root can take up water for the plant.	The root grows fruit because root always grows first.
1584	incorrect	The tree blocks the light from the Sun.	Because the tree is of front.
4579	incorrect	Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.	Once a solution is saturated it is at its highest level of concentration.
4934	incorrect	When the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	It will change by the pitch will be soft.
4383	incorrect	The shorter the string is, the more the string swings in 15 seconds.  The longer the string is, the less the string swings in 15 seconds.	It would make 30 swings in 15 seconds.
3387	correct	The embryo contains the tiny leaves and root of the plant.	It is the baby seed.
215	correct	A. The water in Julie's heater got hotter faster (or had a greater temperature change in 20 minutes). The collector in heater A has the greater surface area so the water in A would get hotter faster than the water in B.	A. Her box got the hottest so it had to be A. It had to be A because it was laying down and the sun could get in it more faster than David's.
3770	incorrect	Bubbling means a gas has formed. Gas is a new material. A new material indicates a reaction.	Because it bubbled and fizz.
277	correct	The contour lines are closest together at Q.	I know it is the steepest part because the contour lines are closer together.
2767	incorrect	Like poles repel and opposite poles attract.	They are repelling.

2729	correct	The elytra are used to make sounds.	To make noise.
1908	correct	Earth materials settle out during deposition.	The eroded earth materials during deposition get deposited to a different area.
2408	incorrect	Susan should compare the amount of gas in each bag. The bag with the most gas contains the food with the most sugar.	Finally Susan will have to get a volume tube put the bag in it and press down. Then you are done.
3935	contradictory	40 meters. The change in elevation is 20 meters between A and B and 20 meters between B and C. So the change between A and C is 40 meters. 20 m plus 20 m equals 40 m.	60 meters, Because it said the change in elevation from line A to B is 20 meters so that lets me know to count by 20 meters.
4318	correct	Wendy should hook one end of the wire to the negative side of a D-cell battery and the other end to the positive side of the D-cell battery.	Connect the wire to the D-cell and turn it on.
3750	incorrect	The circuit does not include both contact points on the bulb holder, so the electricity can not go through the bulb.	The bulb will not work because the negative and the positive cannot go in the same way.
4072	correct	The crystals were square with Xs on the surface.	I knew the crystals were salt because of the patterns and shapes.
962	correct	The brass ring would not stick to the nail because the ring is not iron. The nail is a temporary magnet, but brass cannot become a temporary magnet and thus does not stick to magnets.	It would not stick because it did not have iron in it.
3001	correct	The food contains sugar.	The chemical reaction indicates sugar.
3811	incorrect	Shadows change during the day because the Earth is turning. The Sun stays in one place.	Because the sun does not move. It is the car that rotates. So if you move the flashlight it will get off track.

3386	incorrect	The embryo contains the tiny leaves and root of the plant.	Leaves, stem.
3518	incorrect	The seed coat protects the seed until the plant begins to grow.	Outer layer protecting the seed.
1099	correct	Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.	Yes. The black covered one is going to get hotter because black absorbs heat and white reflects the heat.
4808	correct	The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.	The more blocks he puts in the truck the less the truck will travel.
360	correct	The crystals have different shapes. Salt crystals are square with little Xs. The calcite crystals are shaped like needles (long and skinny).	You can tell them apart because the calcite is just lines. The salt crystals were pyramids and squares.
264	correct	The contour lines are closest together at Q.	Q is the steepest part of the map the line is close together.
1907	incorrect	Earth materials settle out during deposition.	During deposition earth materials are moved to different places.
3659	incorrect	As time increases, the number of tree rings also increases.	That the time goes up.

4295	incorrect	Wendy should hook one end of the wire to the negative side of a D-cell battery and the other end to the positive side of the D-cell battery.	She should see if the magnet works as a electromagnet.
651	correct	Solar water heaters with blue collectors heat up faster than solar water heaters with red collectors.	The blue collects more heat, because it is more darker than red.
3457	correct	The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.	I think X and Y's temperature would be the same because it is the same just flipped.
501	correct	The saxophone has the longest and fattest tube.	Because it is the biggest instrument and the bigger it is the bigger vibrations and the bigger vibrations the lower it sounds.
919	correct	When the string was shorter, the pitch was higher.	The shorter the string the higher the sound.
125	contradictory	In the afternoon, shadows point east because the Sun is in the west. So the west side is opposite of the shadows.	Because when the sun is in the east your shadow is really big like in the picture. So if the sun is in the east I would know.
3612	correct	The rubber band vibrates.	Because it vibrates.
3978	incorrect	The cotyledon provides food for the plant until the plant can make food for itself.	Stores food.
293	incorrect	The boat with 0 marbles is the standard in this experiment.	Jack's standard is using marbles instead of pennies.

2401	incorrect	The salt crystals are squares with Xs on top.	I do not know.
38	correct	Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.	Yes because different materials have different solubility.
4117	incorrect	Water will always flow downhill (mountain to valley).	The delta.
2410	correct	Susan should compare the amount of gas in each bag. The bag with the most gas contains the food with the most sugar.	If one puff up more that means that it has sugar in it.
2159	incorrect	The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.	The batteries are negative to negative.
2950	incorrect	If gas (carbon dioxide) is produced, the food contains acid. If no gas is produced, the food does not contain acid.	The more carbon dioxide the more carbon dioxide it has in it.
3233	incorrect	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Sammy - Because they are not the same material.
968	incorrect	The brass ring would not stick to the nail because the ring is not iron. The nail is a temporary magnet, but brass cannot become a temporary magnet and thus does not stick to magnets.	It would not go on the nail because a brass key has no magnetism in it.
4731	correct	When the string is tighter, the pitch will be higher.	It would become a higher pitch from when she did not have it tight.
1493	incorrect	Emily's crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals shown on the key.	I chose it because on the key it looks the same as the crystal evaporating dish.
4518	contradictory	A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.	B. Because line A is hotter. Water tends to get hotter than anything. So the soil is line B. Soil cannot get as hot as 44 to 43 Celsius.
3041	incorrect	The cotyledon provides food for the plant to begin growing.	Food supply.
1275	incorrect	20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.	Because if you think of it it will be what you are looking for.
148	correct	No, Fruity cream cookies are not pure sugar. The cookies did not produce as much gas as was produced by the pure sugar.	No but they do have sugar. If it was pure sugar, it would be 200 milliliters not 150 milliliters like it is.
3481	correct	Darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors. The dark green sheeting is the darkest color available so she should use the green sheeting.	If she uses dark plastic the water will heat up more quickly.
988	incorrect	The brass ring would not stick to the nail because the ring is not iron. The nail is a temporary magnet, but brass cannot become a temporary magnet and thus does not stick to magnets.	It will not attract because brass is not magnetism so it will not stick.
3873	incorrect	The loops begin at opposite sides of the print.	The loops are going different ways.
2295	incorrect	The fizzing indicates a gas, a new material, is produced. When a new material is produced, a chemical reaction has occurred.	Because it fizzed and moved so that is how.
4095	correct	The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.	Maybe because in the little dish there is little holes and it will not go through it.
4767	incorrect	The crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals.	Because it is crystals and the things look like them.
4336	incorrect	2: Trace the features from the photograph onto the overlay grid. 4: Transfer the features to the matching squares on the smaller grid in your notebook.	2. Copy all objects from a bird's eye view. 4. See what square has what in it and copy it in the same square on the smaller one.
783	incorrect	No, string is an insulator, so the pathway would not be completed.	It would not work. It would have to be a wire to be able to work because it is not metal.
581	incorrect	The motor will continue to run because the motor still has a pathway to the D-cell.	The motor will stay on because the wire is coming out of the positive end and the back.

4693	correct	The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.	I pick this one because if you split solution B into 2 water levels it will be 50 so if A is 50 and 2 spoons the other one is going to have to have 2 spoons too because the other one is double.
4583	contradictory	Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.	I chose cup 2 because it has more solute in it.

3416	incorrect	An experiment is controlled if only one variable is changed at a time.	To do one at a time.
3624	contradictory	The rubber band vibrates.	Because it snaps.
2911	incorrect	The mirror would complete the image of the object and make the object appear whole.	I would see the figure then I would see the line of symmetry.
2345	correct	If the key sticks, the key is iron; if the key does not stick the key is aluminum.	If it were iron it would stick.
258	incorrect	The contour lines are closest together at Q.	I know because Q is at the bottom of the map.
3933	contradictory	40 meters. The change in elevation is 20 meters between A and B and 20 meters between B and C. So the change between A and C is 40 meters. 20 m plus 20 m equals 40 m.	225, You keep adding 75.
4075	incorrect	The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.	Because sand is much softer and the salt.
3176	incorrect	During a flood there is more water in the creek and the water flows faster.	It overflows in a creek and a lake on river.
3744	incorrect	The circuit does not include both contact points on the bulb holder, so the electricity can not go through the bulb.	Yes even though it is not a complete circuit.
3471	correct	Darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors. The dark green sheeting is the darkest color available so she should use the green sheeting.	Because dark green is a dark color like black that way dark green absorbs more heat.
3361	incorrect	There is 30 grams (20 grams plus 10 grams) in the right cup. The balance is tipped down on the ball side which means the ball weighs more than 30 grams. 40 grams is the only weight heavier than 30 grams.	Because 20 grams and 10 grams is 30 grams.
2946	incorrect	If gas (carbon dioxide) is produced, the food contains acid. If no gas is produced, the food does not contain acid.	The test results tell her how much gas is in the food.
4439	incorrect	Measure out equal masses of walnuts and peanuts. Smash the samples uniformly in the same size area on brown paper. Wait the same time for each sample.	First you get the food. Then you get brown paper or some type of paper. Next you squish the peanuts and walnuts on 2 pieces of paper. Finally you wait 3 days before checking the grease marks.
2744	incorrect	The elytra are used to make sounds.	Strangulating.
1456	correct	Rub the minerals together and see which one scratches the other.	Rub them together and see if you can scratch it harder.
263	incorrect	The contour lines are closest together at Q.	Because it is in the middle and it is steeper.
3286	incorrect	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Sammy - I think, Sammy because it has different materials and different sounds.
4665	correct	Overly Orange takes fewer drops to change the color of indophenol so Overly Orange has a higher concentration of vitamin C.	Overly Orange. It has less drops and which one is less has higher vitamin C.
2561	correct	The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.	It happens because it is a parallel circuit.
1725	contradictory	The bulb will light.	It is going to stop.
2235	incorrect	Different girls are throwing the balls. The girls use different launch techniques. Each girl uses a different type of ball.	They did not control the size, and they did not control the type of ball they used.
4413	correct	Fruitsnap contains little or no vitamin C so Fruitsnap does not change the color of the indophenol.	Because Fruitsnap does not have any vitamin C.
2195	correct	All variables except the girl need to be held constant (controlled). The girls all need to throw the same ball and use the same launch technique.	They need to throw the same kind of ball, they need to throw at the same place and they need to get the same speed.
1405	contradictory	There is a complete circuit connecting the bulb to the D-cell battery.	That will happen because there is an open circuit so the electricity will travel to the source.
1050	incorrect	The marbles used by the 2 groups were probably different masses.	Because there all sort of apples and they do all weigh different.
2844	incorrect	Put acid on a rock. If the acid fizzes, Phil would know that the rock has calcite.	He would observe the calcite. Look for calcite in rocks. And then when you think you found it put it in the water.
3328	contradictory	There is 30 grams (20 grams plus 10 grams) in the right cup. The balance is tipped down on the ball side which means the ball weighs more than 30 grams. 40 grams is the only weight heavier than 30 grams.	Because it is already 30 and it is too heavy. So 20.
4791	contradictory	The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.	The more blocks you put on the truck the farther it gets, in meters.
4339	incorrect	2: Trace the features from the photograph onto the overlay grid. 4: Transfer the features to the matching squares on the smaller grid in your notebook.	2. Copy the thing under the grid on the grid. 4. Actually draw it.
726	incorrect	In the morning the Sun is in the east so shadows point west. In the afternoon the Sun is in the west so shadows point east.	Because the sun moves around. So it will shine the opposite direction.
4142	incorrect	The water was evaporated, leaving the salt.	By letting it sit in a dish for a day.
4553	incorrect	The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.	Because sand is heavier and since the sand is heavier it would go down from clay and there is a bigger amount of sand too.
149	correct	No, Fruity cream cookies are not pure sugar. The cookies did not produce as much gas as was produced by the pure sugar.	No because the experiment tells so cookies have 150 while sugar has 200.
591	contradictory	The motor will continue to run because the motor still has a pathway to the D-cell.	The motor will go out.
1805	incorrect	When less than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the greater the mass of beans harvested. When more than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the less the mass of beans harvested.	Every time she put in scoops it went up until 3 scoops. Then it went down.
2759	incorrect	The elytra are used to make sounds.	To protect itself.
4010	incorrect	As time increases, the speed of light stays the same (remains constant).	I think this graph tells me that the time is about 40 seconds and speed of light is about 25.
903	correct	When the string was shorter, the pitch was higher.	The pitch would be higher because the vibrations do not travel as long.
941	contradictory	Water heats up faster when covered.	How the temperature goes upward down.
3600	correct	The rubber band vibrates.	A rubber band makes a sound because vibration are made and sounds come from vibrations.
4016	correct	As time increases, the speed of light stays the same (remains constant).	As time goes on the speed of light stays the same.
3925	incorrect	Agree. Vibrations are movements. Vibrations produce sound.	Yes because if you do not move it will not make sound.
417	correct	If a part of the plant contains seeds, that part is the fruit.	Does it have seeds is it covering seeds.
4359	correct	The shorter the string is, the more the string swings in 15 seconds.  The longer the string is, the less the string swings in 15 seconds.	The longer the swinger the less swings it makes.
4966	contradictory	When the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	The pitch will go high.
810	contradictory	No, string is an insulator, so the pathway would not be completed.	Yes and why is that up put in the 2 holes and the you can make electricity.
4137	incorrect	Water will always flow downhill (mountain to valley).	I think it flows there because the river eroded the valley and the water would be flowing down the valley.
2034	correct	If the effort is applied farther from the fulcrum, less effort will lift the load.	The farther away from the fulcrum less effort is needed.
2171	incorrect	The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.	The motors will not run because the D-cells has to be switched around.
553	correct	Use a standard unit of measurement such as centimeters or meters.	They could have used a meter tape.
829	incorrect	A solution is a mixture formed when a solid dissolves in a liquid.	Because it is made of 2 mixtures, and making it one mixture and becoming a solution of 2 mixtures.
3724	incorrect	The circuit does not include both contact points on the bulb holder, so the electricity can not go through the bulb.	Because the positive wire is taking the energy right away.
143	contradictory	No, Fruity cream cookies are not pure sugar. The cookies did not produce as much gas as was produced by the pure sugar.	I think yes and no because cookies are not just pure sugar they are sweet as well so they do have sugar but not a whole lot of sugar.
1486	incorrect	Emily's crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals shown on the key.	Because it shows the pictures below.
1556	correct	If the string is shorter, the pitch will be higher. If the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	The small string has a higher pitch because you pluck it and it goes so fast that it has a high pitch.
4499	correct	The root grows first so the root can take up water for the plant.	So the root can suck up the water.
2605	correct	The launch position (line on the playground) is the variable that is controlled.	Where the place they had to throw the ball from.
4068	incorrect	The crystals were square with Xs on the surface.	Because it tastes like salt.
3331	correct	There is 30 grams (20 grams plus 10 grams) in the right cup. The balance is tipped down on the ball side which means the ball weighs more than 30 grams. 40 grams is the only weight heavier than 30 grams.	I chose this answer because it could not be 30 grams because the ball is lower so it must be 40 grams.
234	correct	A. The water in Julie's heater got hotter faster (or had a greater temperature change in 20 minutes). The collector in heater A has the greater surface area so the water in A would get hotter faster than the water in B.	A. The evidence that supports my answer is A box because with a long section colored black, the solar heater would absorb more heat and the temperature under Julie's name because the temperature is hotter than David's.
4884	incorrect	Both finger patterns are loops.	Patterns below then.
4490	correct	The root grows first so the root can take up water for the plant.	The root grows first because the root suck up the water that the seed needs.
4354	incorrect	2: Trace the features from the photograph onto the overlay grid. 4: Transfer the features to the matching squares on the smaller grid in your notebook.	2. Draw a overlay grid. 4. Draw a map grid.

2400	incorrect	The salt crystals are squares with Xs on top.	I do not know.
2433	correct	Susan should compare the amount of gas in each bag. The bag with the most gas contains the food with the most sugar.	The more air in the bag, the more sugar.
3777	correct	Bubbling means a gas has formed. Gas is a new material. A new material indicates a reaction.	He knew because when bubbles pop a gas is released into the air.
2965	incorrect	If gas (carbon dioxide) is produced, the food contains acid. If no gas is produced, the food does not contain acid.	The results will tell her how much sugar the pizza has or acid.
2643	correct	The mixtures are all clear.	If the material dissolved it is a solution.
1614	correct	The tree blocks the light from the Sun.	The tree has a shadow because it is blocking the sun's light.
2300	correct	No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.	No she cannot. Why is because she only has one switch and she has to have 2 for both to work.
2976	incorrect	The food contains sugar.	Carbon Dioxide carbon dioxide.
3250	incorrect	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Sammy - Because those are all different materials.
4185	incorrect	Many tiny bubbles will rise from the calcite when the calcite contacts the cold acid.	I would observe many bubbles staying on the calcite, and some floating to the top.
4868	incorrect	Both finger patterns are loops.	Because you look at the finger patterns.
3672	correct	As time increases, the number of tree rings also increases.	As time goes on the number of tree rings are increasing as it goes.
2423	correct	Susan should compare the amount of gas in each bag. The bag with the most gas contains the food with the most sugar.	The food that has the most, carbon dioxide, carbon dioxide has the most sugar.
3123	incorrect	Compare prints to see if the patterns are the same.	I tell what is he mean.
2984	correct	The food contains sugar.	That the food she tested did contain sugar.
2531	incorrect	Topaz would be the hardest of the 4 minerals because none of the tools could scratch topaz and at least one tool could scratch each of the other minerals.	Like steel if you rub them and if it does not scratch.
513	correct	The saxophone has the longest and fattest tube.	Because it is the biggest.
1095	correct	Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.	Yes. Because black heats up faster and white reflects.
1316	incorrect	Set up evaporation dishes. The water will go into the air (evaporate) and the solid will be left in the dish (crystallize).	1. Take a paper filter. 2. Get the filter wet. 3. Pour the mixture in. 4. Let the filter dry. 5. The mixture is separated.
761	incorrect	X. When equal amounts of 2 solutions are compared, the solution that is more concentrated will have the greater mass (weigh more). 50 milliliters of X has a greater mass than 50 milliliters of Y, so X must be more concentrated.	X, I know that solution x is more concentrated.
1870	incorrect	A car is made of a lot of iron or steel.	It might hit the electricity to make it work.
1451	incorrect	Rub the minerals together and see which one scratches the other.	Rubbing them together.
1293	correct	Set up evaporation dishes. The water will go into the air (evaporate) and the solid will be left in the dish (crystallize).	He could put in a evaporation tray and see the solid material!
4478	incorrect	The root grows first so the root can take up water for the plant.	The root grows first because it needs to make food for the seed.
2359	correct	If the key sticks, the key is iron; if the key does not stick the key is aluminum.	If the key attracts is iron. If it repels is aluminum.
3282	incorrect	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Sammy - Because metal makes a very loud sound.
2982	correct	The food contains sugar.	Chemical reaction means it has what you are looking for, sugar, acid, fat.
494	correct	A solution was created when the eggshells disappeared (dissolved) and the mixture ended up as a clear liquid.	It is a solution because the eggshells disappeared leaving liquid clear making a solution.
4725	correct	When the string is tighter, the pitch will be higher.	The pitch would get higher.
1875	incorrect	A car is made of a lot of iron or steel.	If the car goes over the magnet faster than 5 miles per hour it should turn green.
3832	correct	So people know exactly what the measurement means. A standard is necessary so everyone measures using the same unit and everyone gets the same measurement.	Because if you do not use it you may get the wrong answer.
4850	incorrect	When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.	The magnet made the paperclips stick on because the magnetism flowing through.
3461	correct	The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.	It would be the same because it does not matter what position the black surface area is, it matters what size.
106	incorrect	In the afternoon, shadows point east because the Sun is in the west. So the west side is opposite of the shadows.	I used the strategy never eat soggy waffles.
2942	incorrect	If gas (carbon dioxide) is produced, the food contains acid. If no gas is produced, the food does not contain acid.	If it has a lot of sugar a little bit of sugar or no sugar at all.
2402	correct	The salt crystals are squares with Xs on top.	They have a square with a X in it.
1643	incorrect	The water splashed because the fork was vibrating. Vibrations make sounds.	Because she can be know that the vibration travel in the water.
1119	incorrect	Seeing multiple colors would show that vinegar can separate the permanent ink.	She will put vinegar on the permanent ink to see if it will spread.
931	incorrect	Water heats up faster when covered.	That the sun absorbs more heat, with dark colors.
4513	incorrect	A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.	A. Because A was the higher than the other one because it is hot inside because dry not wet.
286	contradictory	The boat with 0 marbles is the standard in this experiment.	3.
2503	correct	That circuit is the only circuit that uses all of the correct contact points.	Because the electricity goes to the metal and that electricity goes to the filament.
2792	correct	Like poles repel and opposite poles attract.	The rings do not touch because the top is south pole is the one below it is the south pole. When the poles are north and south they attract.
1269	correct	20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.	I chose 6 Celsius because you would be counting by 3's if there was a 20 centimeters long, because the length of each container was counting by 10's.
4531	incorrect	A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.	A. The graph help me because I know that dry soil is black which perhaps it will get hotter unlike the water it reflects the sun's energy.
440	incorrect	Earth materials erode and are carried by flowing water (a river). The earth materials form a delta when the materials are dropped off or deposited when the water stops flowing (at the mouth of a river).	A deposition at the mouth of the river.
2130	incorrect	A chemical reaction occurred. [The white solid is a precipitate (a new material) which indicates the reaction.]	There is a precipitate on the bottom.
3494	correct	Darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors. The dark green sheeting is the darkest color available so she should use the green sheeting.	Because when you have a dark color it absorbs more of the heat, so that is why Sue should put dark green at the bottom of the pool.
4914	incorrect	She recommended the topographic map because the map shows the elevations along the trail. Pam would know where the trail was the steepest.	Because it gives better directions and trails.
1223	incorrect	Lee should put one of the loose wires on one part of the object and the other loose wire on another part of the object and see if the object completes the circuit.	He can put all the wires together to make a circle and have that run.
4285	incorrect	Wendy should hook one end of the wire to the negative side of a D-cell battery and the other end to the positive side of the D-cell battery.	Stick it into the clips and close the switch.
4593	contradictory	Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.	It clearly states that 2 has more.
4685	contradictory	The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.	I chose cup A because it seems more concentrated.
3061	correct	A standard is used for comparison to determine how changing one variable changes the results.	You use a standard to see if you can try a less amount each time you do an experiment.
3953	correct	40 meters. The change in elevation is 20 meters between A and B and 20 meters between B and C. So the change between A and C is 40 meters. 20 m plus 20 m equals 40 m.	40 meters, I know this because A to B is 20 meters and the next contour line is another 20 meters away it must be 40 meters.
4419	correct	Fruitsnap contains little or no vitamin C so Fruitsnap does not change the color of the indophenol.	Because it does not have as much vitamin C as Overly Orange or Luscious Lemon.
3567	incorrect	The rubber band vibrates.	Because it is.
3223	contradictory	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Nathaniel - I picked Nathaniel because a wooden blocks has a low sound and Sammy wants to use blocks made of plastic, metal, and wood. And the objects will make a low sound.
3370	incorrect	The embryo contains the tiny leaves and root of the plant.	The seed.
489	correct	A solution was created when the eggshells disappeared (dissolved) and the mixture ended up as a clear liquid.	I think she did make a solution because a solution is when 2 or more materials are mixed together and one disappears into the other.
1016	incorrect	The sand particles are larger and settle first. The flour particles are smaller and therefore settle more slowly.	They separate because the water makes them into layers by making water onto sand in middle and gray material on bottom.
170	correct	No, Fruity cream cookies are not pure sugar. The cookies did not produce as much gas as was produced by the pure sugar.	No, Fruity Cream cookies are not pure sugar because pure sugar is about 200 and Fruity Cream cookies are at least 150 milliliters.
4638	contradictory	C. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. Pan C has the most dark surface area so C would heat up the fastest and have the highest temperature.	A. Because energy did not have much to heat so it focused on that one thing.
3813	contradictory	Shadows change during the day because the Earth is turning. The Sun stays in one place.	He would move the flashlight around and the shadow would move. If he started the globe the flashlight would just be shining on the globe and not the golf tee so he would not be figuring out how shadows change during the day.
3619	correct	The rubber band vibrates.	Because it is vibrating.
4389	incorrect	The shorter the string is, the more the string swings in 15 seconds.  The longer the string is, the less the string swings in 15 seconds.	It changes the number of the swing.
4564	correct	The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.	It is deposited there because it is lighter than sand and pebbles.
4278	correct	Crystals of different materials have different shapes. So the shape will help identify the material.	Use all the salt then wait for them to evaporate but in the other trays name them by the salt so he would know which one is which but then there done he can see which one looks like that one.
3893	incorrect	The loops begin at opposite sides of the print.	The first one a man print and the second kid.
3540	incorrect	The seed coat protects the seed until the plant begins to grow.	Protect the cotyledon.
2962	incorrect	If gas (carbon dioxide) is produced, the food contains acid. If no gas is produced, the food does not contain acid.	The end or final will go white after it.
3821	correct	Shadows change during the day because the Earth is turning. The Sun stays in one place.	Because the only way it would move to a different place is if you rotate the globe. If you were just moving the flashlight it will not really do anything.
2612	incorrect	The launch position (line on the playground) is the variable that is controlled.	They threw the balls.
3283	incorrect	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Sammy - I thought Sammy's idea was easier because different sizes and shapes is harder.
1639	incorrect	The water splashed because the fork was vibrating. Vibrations make sounds.	Because it vibrated so since that vibrated she noticed the splash and she thought it must of been vibration.
709	incorrect	Use a standard unit of mass like grams.	One group could use an apple then when they are done the other group could use it.
1616	incorrect	The water splashed because the fork was vibrating. Vibrations make sounds.	By a ping pong ball, a table, a cup full of water, and most of all hitting it too hard.
1994	contradictory	You can not tell because we do not know the strength of the magnets. If the magnets are weak, the second piece of foam might put too much distance between the 2 magnets for the interaction to hold the magnets in place. If the magnets are strong the magnets might stay in place.	Because 2 foam blocks are a lot thicker for the magnetic field to get through.
1472	incorrect	Emily's crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals shown on the key.	Because crystals look like a small amount and have lines on the side something each crystal has its own shape.
4772	incorrect	The crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals.	Alum has things inside so I look at the picture and it has things inside so I knew it was alum.
2656	incorrect	The mixtures are all clear.	He does not have an idea that island make a salt outline.
1157	incorrect	Yes, aluminum foil is a metal and all metals conduct. The aluminum foil would complete the circuit.	Yes you could because the aluminum foil will go through the circuit.
4351	incorrect	2: Trace the features from the photograph onto the overlay grid. 4: Transfer the features to the matching squares on the smaller grid in your notebook.	2. See how much square cubes on the overlay grid fit in the photograph. 2. Count how much fits in the smaller cubes.
2399	incorrect	The salt crystals are squares with Xs on top.	Is just tiny and big because of crystals.
3869	correct	The loops begin at opposite sides of the print.	One loop is coming from the left and the other one the right.
2719	correct	So that people notice the sound.	Because the car needs to get to someplace very quick.
521	incorrect	The saxophone has the longest and fattest tube.	Because it has to travel longer.
2364	incorrect	If the key sticks, the key is iron; if the key does not stick the key is aluminum.	You will know because it will stick to a magnet.
4184	incorrect	Many tiny bubbles will rise from the calcite when the calcite contacts the cold acid.	I would see if the rocks bubble.
2082	correct	There is a complete circuit connecting the motor to the D-cell battery.	It will work because that is closing the switch.
4251	incorrect	Crystals of different materials have different shapes. So the shape will help identify the material.	He should look for the solid material in his house or store.
3538	incorrect	The seed coat protects the seed until the plant begins to grow.	This is the outer layer that covers the seed.
4050	incorrect	The crystals were square with Xs on the surface.	Because salt is made up of little crystals.
565	correct	Use a standard unit of measurement such as centimeters or meters.	They could use a ruler to measure the rug better then they got the right answer.
3752	incorrect	Bubbling means a gas has formed. Gas is a new material. A new material indicates a reaction.	Because the mixture bubbled.
1608	incorrect	The tree blocks the light from the Sun.	Because the sun is behind the tree and the shadow is in front of it.
3861	incorrect	The loops begin at opposite sides of the print.	They are different thumbs of people.
535	correct	Use a standard unit of measurement such as centimeters or meters.	They could use a measuring tape and that is how they will get the same answer.
975	correct	The brass ring would not stick to the nail because the ring is not iron. The nail is a temporary magnet, but brass cannot become a temporary magnet and thus does not stick to magnets.	The brass ring would not have any iron in it so it would not stick.
4401	incorrect	Fruitsnap contains little or no vitamin C so Fruitsnap does not change the color of the indophenol.	Probably because they did something wrong and it did not work.
190	incorrect	A reaction was indicated by the bubbles of gas (a new material) being produced.	Because there were bubbles.
4629	incorrect	C. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. Pan C has the most dark surface area so C would heat up the fastest and have the highest temperature.	C. The cake pan C had the most black in it so it warmed up the quickest and made the water warmer.
4090	correct	The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.	Because the sand is bigger than the salt.
4365	correct	The shorter the string is, the more the string swings in 15 seconds.  The longer the string is, the less the string swings in 15 seconds.	The shorter the string the faster it swings and the longer the string the slower it swings.
3550	correct	The rubber band vibrates.	Because it vibrates.
461	incorrect	A solution was created when the eggshells disappeared (dissolved) and the mixture ended up as a clear liquid.	Because bubble came out of the eggshell.

640	correct	Solar water heaters with blue collectors heat up faster than solar water heaters with red collectors.	Blue will get hotter because it is a dark color and red is not.
3201	contradictory	Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.	No because if you had Kool-aid the one with more water will give the powder more space to dissolve, but the one with less water will saturate because there is less space for the powder to dissolve.
1692	incorrect	Jim would see a clear solution. 3 spoons of solid dissolves, so 2 spoons will dissolve.	It would be a solution. One and 3 have either one spoon or 2 spoons of solid in their mixtures and they are still a solution.
2131	incorrect	A chemical reaction occurred. [The white solid is a precipitate (a new material) which indicates the reaction.]	It is a product on the bottom of the cap.
363	incorrect	The crystals have different shapes. Salt crystals are square with little Xs. The calcite crystals are shaped like needles (long and skinny).	The salt crystals look like squares.

357	incorrect	The crystals have different shapes. Salt crystals are square with little Xs. The calcite crystals are shaped like needles (long and skinny).	Calcite is straight lines.
2416	correct	Susan should compare the amount of gas in each bag. The bag with the most gas contains the food with the most sugar.	Susan will know how much sugar is in the foods by putting each bag in a volume tube one at a time. When her finder stops after pushing the top, the bottom of the part she pushes down will be on a number. That number is the milliliters of sugar in the food. Whichever number is the highest, that means that food has the most sugar.
134	correct	In the afternoon, shadows point east because the Sun is in the west. So the west side is opposite of the shadows.	Because the sun would probably be northwest for the shadow to face southeast.
3503	incorrect	Darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors. The dark green sheeting is the darkest color available so she should use the green sheeting.	Because the darker the color the faster it will heat up.
4931	incorrect	She recommended the topographic map because the map shows the elevations along the trail. Pam would know where the trail was the steepest.	It tells you where things are.

2214	incorrect	All variables except the girl need to be held constant (controlled). The girls all need to throw the same ball and use the same launch technique.	They should all stand at the line and throw.
2008	correct	You can not tell because we do not know the strength of the magnets. If the magnets are weak, the second piece of foam might put too much distance between the 2 magnets for the interaction to hold the magnets in place. If the magnets are strong the magnets might stay in place.	I chose C. It might stick, but it might not because it depends on how strong the magnet is.
886	correct	When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.	That will not not provide useful information because you would only know blue covered red uncovered.
1597	correct	The tree blocks the light from the Sun.	Because the tree is in the sun's way so it will cast off a shadow.
267	incorrect	The contour lines are closest together at Q.	Because it curves going up the mountain.

1421	incorrect	There is a complete circuit connecting the bulb to the D-cell battery.	Because it is on an.
1380	incorrect	You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.	You have to pull twice as much rope to lift the load.
4541	incorrect	The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.	Because once the clay is picked up it is moved and dropped off outside of the mouth.
821	correct	A solution is a mixture formed when a solid dissolves in a liquid.	It dissolves the solid into a liquid that is see through.
1211	incorrect	Bill must have been using degrees Celsius if 28 is a warm temperature.	Thermometer.

4856	incorrect	When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.	The magnet has enough power to pick up more things. What happens is the magnetic field goes around and the clips sticks to clip and then that clips up another and so forth.
1219	incorrect	Lee should put one of the loose wires on one part of the object and the other loose wire on another part of the object and see if the object completes the circuit.	Touch the wires together.
3066	incorrect	A standard is used for comparison to determine how changing one variable changes the results.	In a controlled experiment you use a standard because when you are testing something else you will have to compare your answers. That is where a standard comes in.
3709	incorrect	Fabric A is smoother and has a finer texture. Fabric B is rougher and has a coarser texture.	One is dark and the other is not and okay you can see them better.
959	correct	Water heats up faster when covered.	By saying that the covered one get more hotter and the darker it is it is going to end up hot.
2073	contradictory	The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.	Greater than because it has more scoops.
1854	incorrect	The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.	Because they are big.
723	correct	In the morning the Sun is in the east so shadows point west. In the afternoon the Sun is in the west so shadows point east.	The sun rises in the east so the shadow was on the west and the sun sets in the west so the shadow was on the east.
4955	correct	When the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	A low pitch.
3224	incorrect	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Sammy - Because the metal and wood makes a louder sound kind of like vibration.

1528	correct	The motor will run.	It will come on.
3940	contradictory	40 meters. The change in elevation is 20 meters between A and B and 20 meters between B and C. So the change between A and C is 40 meters. 20 m plus 20 m equals 40 m.	30 meters, I measured with my fingers that C was half of B, and since B is 20 and half of that is 10 I added both of them together and got 30 meters.
1098	incorrect	Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.	Yes. If she wanted to heat up a box it would be the black one because a dark color takes the heat faster than the white one because white is brighter than black.
2119	incorrect	A chemical reaction occurred. [The white solid is a precipitate (a new material) which indicates the reaction.]	The chemical that stayed down there.
4471	correct	The root grows first so the root can take up water for the plant.	The root grows first because the seed needs water to grow.

3254	incorrect	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Sammy - Because if you used blocks made of plastic metal and wood because it would make a differing noise so it would be easier to know.
2052	correct	The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.	The same because in the picture of mixture 4 and 5, they show the same salt on the bottom.
2170	incorrect	The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.	The motor shall not run because electricity flows out of the negative side of the battery.
3492	contradictory	Darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors. The dark green sheeting is the darkest color available so she should use the green sheeting.	Because yellow is a light color and would reflect the sun's energy.
4233	incorrect	Anna should compare the size of the grease spots. The sample with the larger grease spot has more fat.	Then she will know that walnut or peanuts has more fat.

704	correct	Use a standard unit of mass like grams.	They should use grams to weigh the apple.
1803	correct	When less than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the greater the mass of beans harvested. When more than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the less the mass of beans harvested.	Well 3 is the perfect amount because 4 is too many 2 is not enough.
4201	incorrect	Many tiny bubbles will rise from the calcite when the calcite contacts the cold acid.	If I in a test on as rock with acid I will put acid on the rock and let it settle overnight.
4046	incorrect	The crystals were square with Xs on the surface.	Because it was at it because we had a chart that could tell us that.
1585	correct	The tree blocks the light from the Sun.	Because the sun hits the tree with light and part of the tree is breaking it creates a shadow.
30	incorrect	Elena should include a separate shelter for each lizard.	She should put a prop of a lizard to see if her lizard will let it be or fight it.
2706	correct	So that people notice the sound.	So people know there is an emergency.

4847	incorrect	When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.	The magnetic force went through the paperclips.
4076	incorrect	The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.	Because the salt dissolved into the water and the sand did not.
2869	incorrect	A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.	If you use a bigger hole more water come out at once like a raging river, if the slope is steeper the water will push through the earth material faster.
4060	incorrect	The crystals were square with Xs on the surface.	Because it was so shiny.
4958	correct	When the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	The pitch will be low.

1503	correct	The motor will run.	The motor will run.
4430	correct	Fruitsnap contains little or no vitamin C so Fruitsnap does not change the color of the indophenol.	It did not change because it had not much vitamin C, so it would take a lot of drops.
4421	correct	Fruitsnap contains little or no vitamin C so Fruitsnap does not change the color of the indophenol.	Because Fruitsnap did not have a lot of vitamin C in it.
4548	incorrect	The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.	Because it is so light.
1969	correct	If the middle bulb burns out the other 2 bulbs will stay lit.	The light will still run.
4466	incorrect	Measure out equal masses of walnuts and peanuts. Smash the samples uniformly in the same size area on brown paper. Wait the same time for each sample.	She will measure and leave them 20 day to see how much she did it.
2971	incorrect	If gas (carbon dioxide) is produced, the food contains acid. If no gas is produced, the food does not contain acid.	It would tell her that how much acid is in lemon, lime, or tangerine.
4855	correct	When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.	He did that because the magnet has a lot of power so it picked up on paperclip then that paperclip is a temporary magnet and passes the power.
657	correct	Solar water heaters with blue collectors heat up faster than solar water heaters with red collectors.	If a color is dark it will heat up more than a light one so blue was dark red was light.
4527	incorrect	A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.	A. A because dry heats up faster because it has no breeze or moisten anything to where is absorbs more.
478	correct	A solution was created when the eggshells disappeared (dissolved) and the mixture ended up as a clear liquid.	Grace thinks she made a solution because first she put eggshells into a cup and covered them up with vinegar and then small bubbles appeared on the surface of the eggshell and a couple of days the eggshells were gone and the liquid was clear.
1404	contradictory	There is a complete circuit connecting the bulb to the D-cell battery.	It will happen because right now it is a closed circuit, so if she moves it to the left it will be an open circuit.
448	incorrect	Earth materials erode and are carried by flowing water (a river).

If the magnets are weak, the second piece of foam might put too much distance between the 2 magnets for the interaction to hold the magnets in place. If the magnets are strong the magnets might stay in place.	I chose that answer because the 2 foam blocks are so thick that the magnetism cannot get through them.
4024	incorrect	As time increases, the speed of light stays the same (remains constant).	As time goes on the number goes to the middle.
4663	correct	Overly Orange takes fewer drops to change the color of indophenol so Overly Orange has a higher concentration of vitamin C.	Yes because vitamin C makes the indicator clear and the lower amount of drops the more vitamin C.

629	correct	When the string was tighter, the pitch was higher.	When the string is tightened, the pitch is higher not lower.
2580	correct	The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.	That means it is a parallel circuit and if 2 bulbs burn out one will still be lit.
366	incorrect	The crystals have different shapes. Salt crystals are square with little Xs. The calcite crystals are shaped like needles (long and skinny).	I know that crystals are different than salt crystals because the salt crystals do not have needle like structures.
734	incorrect	In the morning the Sun is in the east so shadows point west. In the afternoon the Sun is in the west so shadows point east.	Because our earth rotates.
1085	incorrect	Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.	Yes. Because the sun hits the boxes and the inside gets really warm. So the thermometer will show the temp.

4714	incorrect	The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.	I chose this one because in the picture above there is more water in cup B.
4112	incorrect	Water will always flow downhill (mountain to valley).	Because it is big at beginning then slowly gets smaller and branches out.
1259	incorrect	20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.	I think the temperature for the new container is smaller, because one is smaller.
2464	incorrect	The circuit is not complete. The electrical pathway is broken.	I chose that answer because it has a positive and a negative.
1850	incorrect	The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.	Because the materials are stuck together with water and cannot go through the tiny holes in the filter.

2785	correct	Like poles repel and opposite poles attract.	They are not touching because there are a north and south on a magnet and the north is facing the other north.
2776	incorrect	Like poles repel and opposite poles attract.	They do not touch each other because the force of magnetism is repelling them away from each other.
930	correct	Water heats up faster when covered.	That covered sometimes gets the hottest.
624	contradictory	When the string was tighter, the pitch was higher.	It would be a low pitch.
1008	incorrect	The sand particles are larger and settle first. The flour particles are smaller and therefore settle more slowly.	They are a soft substance that disintegrates when it mixes with water.
2895	incorrect	A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.	So everything would happen quicker and better.
1346	incorrect	The harder coin will scratch the other.	I do not know.
2076	incorrect	The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.	The same because they both have the same amount of water.
993	contradictory	The brass ring would not stick to the nail because the ring is not iron. The nail is a temporary magnet, but brass cannot become a temporary magnet and thus does not stick to magnets.	The reason why is because the brass ring is a temporary magnet.
960	correct	Water heats up faster when covered.	The graph tells us that the blue covered will get hotter because with the lid it got much more hotter.
503	incorrect	The saxophone has the longest and fattest tube.	Because it is an instrument of the orchestra.

2840	correct	Put acid on a rock. If the acid fizzes, Phil would know that the rock has calcite.	He should put the rock or mineral in a cup and pour vinegar and if it bubble then it calcite.
49	incorrect	Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.	Yes it is.
2924	incorrect	The mirror would complete the image of the object and make the object appear whole.	I would it going further and further.
4515	correct	A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.	A. Because water is the best heat sink and heat sinks absorb solar energy slowly and release it slowly. Dry soil is a heat sink too, but is not the best.
2608	incorrect	The launch position (line on the playground) is the variable that is controlled.	The balls.
3571	contradictory	The rubber band vibrates.	Because each side of the rubber band will snap together.

779	incorrect	X. When equal amounts of 2 solutions are compared, the solution that is more concentrated will have the greater mass (weigh more). 50 milliliters of X has a greater mass than 50 milliliters of Y, so X must be more concentrated.	X, They added more solute into the solution x than solution y. That is why solution x is heavier.
462	correct	A solution was created when the eggshells disappeared (dissolved) and the mixture ended up as a clear liquid.	I think she made a solution because the eggshells and bubbles disappeared.
3796	incorrect	Shadows change during the day because the Earth is turning. The Sun stays in one place.	Because it rotates around the sun.
781	incorrect	X. When equal amounts of 2 solutions are compared, the solution that is more concentrated will have the greater mass (weigh more). 50 milliliters of X has a greater mass than 50 milliliters of Y, so X must be more concentrated.	X, because cup x weighs more than cup y.
3257	incorrect	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Sammy's - Because they sound different.
2284	incorrect	The fizzing indicates a gas, a new material, is produced. When a new material is produced, a chemical reaction has occurred.	Fizzing is a reaction.
1470	incorrect	Emily's crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals shown on the key.	Because I thought it was the best answer.
4866	correct	Both finger patterns are loops.	They are both loops.

1438	correct	Rub the minerals together and see which one scratches the other.	Scratch them together.
3469	correct	Darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors. The dark green sheeting is the darkest color available so she should use the green sheeting.	Why I chose the dark green sheeting was because the darker color absorbs heat.
441	incorrect	Earth materials erode and are carried by flowing water (a river). The earth materials form a delta when the materials are dropped off or deposited when the water stops flowing (at the mouth of a river).	A delta is formed when water is deposited.
3740	incorrect	The circuit does not include both contact points on the bulb holder, so the electricity can not go through the bulb.	More power goes to the motor.
1670	incorrect	If the motor runs, the object is a conductor.	If the light is on or off.
965	correct	The brass ring would not stick to the nail because the ring is not iron. The nail is a temporary magnet, but brass cannot become a temporary magnet and thus does not stick to magnets.	It would not stick because the ring does not have iron or steel in it.
4967	correct	When the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	It will make a lower pitch and yes.
245	correct	A. The water in Julie's heater got hotter faster (or had a greater temperature change in 20 minutes). The collector in heater A has the greater surface area so the water in A would get hotter faster than the water in B.	A. The evidence that supports my answer is the chart or table. I looked at both the temperatures and solar water heaters and I decide, using the chart or table, that A is Julie's.
2009	incorrect	You can not tell because we do not know the strength of the magnets. If the magnets are weak, the second piece of foam might put too much distance between the 2 magnets for the interaction to hold the magnets in place. If the magnets are strong the magnets might stay in place.	Magnetism is strong.
3526	incorrect	The seed coat protects the seed until the plant begins to grow.	Protects the seed.
1200	correct	Bill must have been using degrees Celsius if 28 is a warm temperature.	Uncle Jen is using Celsius.

732	incorrect	In the morning the Sun is in the east so shadows point west. In the afternoon the Sun is in the west so shadows point east.	The earth orbits around the sun so the shadow will change.
3798	contradictory	Shadows change during the day because the Earth is turning. The Sun stays in one place.	Because the sun is going around us while the earth spins in circles which makes it go around.
3342	incorrect	There is 30 grams (20 grams plus 10 grams) in the right cup. The balance is tipped down on the ball side which means the ball weighs more than 30 grams. 40 grams is the only weight heavier than 30 grams.	Because 30 is not high enough.
1083	incorrect	Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.	Yes. It will support Amber's prediction because black is covered and it attracts more solar heat.
1819	incorrect	When less than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the greater the mass of beans harvested. When more than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the less the mass of beans harvested.	When you put 3 it weighs more. If you put a lot like 6 the beans will be dead.
812	correct	No, string is an insulator, so the pathway would not be completed.	No, you cannot. That is because it does not conduct electricity.
4472	incorrect	The root grows first so the root can take up water for the plant.	Because the root is the seed or the to be growing the hair.
2150	incorrect	A chemical reaction occurred. [The white solid is a precipitate (a new material) which indicates the reaction.]	The white solid indicates the crystals.

1280	incorrect	20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.	I decide that the temperature is going to be less.
2039	contradictory	If the effort is applied farther from the fulcrum, less effort will lift the load.	It is harder to lift when the load is far from the load.
356	incorrect	The crystals have different shapes. Salt crystals are square with little Xs. The calcite crystals are shaped like needles (long and skinny).	It if looks like salt then the salt is salt crystals. If it has lines in them it is calcite crystals.
3477	correct	Darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors. The dark green sheeting is the darkest color available so she should use the green sheeting.	The green is almost like black and the darker the sheeting is its color attracts the sun and heats up the pool.
4600	contradictory	Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.	I put C because cup 2 has more spoons of solute so it would be heavier.
625	incorrect	When the string was tighter, the pitch was higher.	It will be louder.
4559	contradictory	The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.	The clay is deposited where I indicated it because it is heaviest so it will not go as far.
4431	correct	Fruitsnap contains little or no vitamin C so Fruitsnap does not change the color of the indophenol.	It did not have any vitamin C.
2245	correct	Different girls are throwing the balls. The girls use different launch techniques. Each girl uses a different type of ball.	One of the variables is the type of ball. And the second one is how many steps they took during the time when they were throwing balls.

3594	correct	The rubber band vibrates.	It moves fast enough to make a sound.
2826	contradictory	A heat sink is any material that absorbs (a lot of) heat.	A heat sink is a heat that is wet.
444	incorrect	Earth materials erode and are carried by flowing water (a river). The earth materials form a delta when the materials are dropped off or deposited when the water stops flowing (at the mouth of a river).	It forms with gravity because it is like metal and plastic.
3685	incorrect	Fabric A is smoother and has a finer texture. Fabric B is rougher and has a coarser texture.	Rubbing A is not that clear because they rubbed it soft and B is rubbed hard.
2382	correct	The salt crystals are squares with Xs on top.	4 squares one X.
3875	correct	The loops begin at opposite sides of the print.	They are going different directions.

796	incorrect	No, string is an insulator, so the pathway would not be completed.	You could not do that because the circuit would not make it.
4145	incorrect	The water was evaporated, leaving the salt.	I saw a pinkish grayish color that was blocking the water.
2832	incorrect	Put acid on a rock. If the acid fizzes, Phil would know that the rock has calcite.	He should put a rock and vinegar into a vial and if the rock has calcite, the water will turn murky.
4963	incorrect	When the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	It would be a longer sound.
2328	correct	No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.	No because she can only turn the switch to the light bulb or the motor.
1489	incorrect	Emily's crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals shown on the key.	Because her drawing looks the same as the one in the shape key.
1650	incorrect	The water splashed because the fork was vibrating. Vibrations make sounds.	By looking at how it vibrates.
1658	correct	If the motor runs, the object is a conductor.	If it runs.
1124	correct	Seeing multiple colors would show that vinegar can separate the permanent ink.	She will either see pigments or it will rise.

2339	incorrect	If the key sticks, the key is iron; if the key does not stick the key is aluminum.	I will stick or not stick.
2397	correct	The salt crystals are squares with Xs on top.	The salt crystals has Xs in the middle of the square.
3731	incorrect	The circuit does not include both contact points on the bulb holder, so the electricity can not go through the bulb.	There is not enough energy.
213	correct	A. The water in Julie's heater got hotter faster (or had a greater temperature change in 20 minutes). The collector in heater A has the greater surface area so the water in A would get hotter faster than the water in B.	A. Because it is larger. B is very skinny.
3437	correct	The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.	It really does not matter the only thing that matters is the amount of area.
620	correct	When the string was tighter, the pitch was higher.	It got high pitch and lower volume.
720	incorrect	In the morning the Sun is in the east so shadows point west. In the afternoon the Sun is in the west so shadows point east.	This happen because the sun moved over the sky.
543	correct	Use a standard unit of measurement such as centimeters or meters.	They should use a standard metric unit to measure the rug like a meter tape.
1871	correct	A car is made of a lot of iron or steel.	The car is made of iron and steel and magnets only stick to iron or steel. So when the car stops it triggers the stoplight.
279	correct	The contour lines are closest together at Q.	I know it is the steepest part of the trail because the lines are the closest together.
2986	incorrect	The food contains sugar.	It had acid.
4262	incorrect	Crystals of different materials have different shapes. So the shape will help identify the material.	Because by the markings and patterns on the crystals your all to identify them.
2633	correct	The mixtures are all clear.	Mixtures one, 3, and possibly 2 are clear a sign that the material has dissolved and made a solution.
2387	incorrect	The salt crystals are squares with Xs on top.	It was while you could see through square.
991	incorrect	The brass ring would not stick to the nail because the ring is not iron. The nail is a temporary magnet, but brass cannot become a temporary magnet and thus does not stick to magnets.	It will put up the ring I think in magnet.
2689	incorrect	You can see how much time is taken for the earth materials to move.	The information that you do get is what happens and what form.
2981	correct	The food contains sugar.	The food has sugar in it.

909	correct	When the string was shorter, the pitch was higher.	It would be a High pitch.
573	correct	The motor will continue to run because the motor still has a pathway to the D-cell.	It will run the same it is a parallel.
1860	correct	The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.	The solid would be too big to pass through the small holes in the filter paper.
1693	correct	Jim would see a clear solution. 3 spoons of solid dissolves, so 2 spoons will dissolve.	He would observe nothing you need more spoons to make it saturated. Because mixture 3 has 3 spoons and it is not saturated.
4702	correct	The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.	Because if he takes 50 milliliters out of A and puts it back in A it is still the same and if he takes 50 milliliters out of B and puts it back in then they are still both the same.
4447	incorrect	Measure out equal masses of walnuts and peanuts. Smash the samples uniformly in the same size area on brown paper. Wait the same time for each sample.	First, she needs brown paper, a scale, and a gram of each food. Anna needs to take a gram of each food and let it sit for 2 days. Then she can determine how much fat is in each food by the size of the grease spot.
214	correct	A. The water in Julie's heater got hotter faster (or had a greater temperature change in 20 minutes). The collector in heater A has the greater surface area so the water in A would get hotter faster than the water in B.	A. Box A got hotter because the temperature in the graph helped me decide.
631	correct	When the string was tighter, the pitch was higher.	When you make it long it make it low sound when you make it short it a height sound.

760	incorrect	X. When equal amounts of 2 solutions are compared, the solution that is more concentrated will have the greater mass (weigh more). 50 milliliters of X has a greater mass than 50 milliliters of Y, so X must be more concentrated.	X, x has less room to move around and y has less room to move around.
3502	incorrect	Darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors. The dark green sheeting is the darkest color available so she should use the green sheeting.	Because heat is absorbed by dark colors.
4398	correct	Fruitsnap contains little or no vitamin C so Fruitsnap does not change the color of the indophenol.	The indophenol did not change color with the Fruitsnap because the Fruitsnap might not have had vitamin C.
383	correct	The crystals have different shapes. Salt crystals are square with little Xs. The calcite crystals are shaped like needles (long and skinny).	Because the crystals from the calcite test were long and skinny. The salt crystals were fat and had designs on.
2808	incorrect	A heat sink is any material that absorbs (a lot of) heat.	It is something like dry soil.
4080	correct	The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.	The particle size of the sand was too big to fit through the holes of the filter. While the salt particle size was too small to get caught.
1799	incorrect	When less than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the greater the mass of beans harvested. When more than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the less the mass of beans harvested.	It goes up until it gets to 3 it goes down all the way to 6.
3101	incorrect	The solid dissolves (seems to disappear) and the liquid remains clear.	You know when the solid is dissolved.
4643	incorrect	C. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. Pan C has the most dark surface area so C would heat up the fastest and have the highest temperature.	C. It has more black circles.
2868	incorrect	A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.	Because if you make them flatter it might take a while but if you make it steeper it might be easier.
395	correct	If a part of the plant contains seeds, that part is the fruit.	It has seeds.
949	correct	Water heats up faster when covered.	It heats up faster.
3989	incorrect	The cotyledon provides food for the plant until the plant can make food for itself.	It folds of when it is done.
3302	incorrect	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Sammy - Because Sammy has all different things. And it is easy to discriminate.
4346	incorrect	2: Trace the features from the photograph onto the overlay grid. 4: Transfer the features to the matching squares on the smaller grid in your notebook.	2. Draw everything on the big map on the overlay grid. 4. Copy the drawings from the overlay grid on to the grid on your notebook paper.

1251	incorrect	20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.	I used subtracting the B from A.
2517	incorrect	Topaz would be the hardest of the 4 minerals because none of the tools could scratch topaz and at least one tool could scratch each of the other minerals.	M to Z is harder than mineral X and Y.
1231	incorrect	Lee should put one of the loose wires on one part of the object and the other loose wire on another part of the object and see if the object completes the circuit.	He can use the circuit by seeing if the object does anything if it works it is a conductor if it does not then it is an insulator.
4194	correct	Many tiny bubbles will rise from the calcite when the calcite contacts the cold acid.	You would see bubbles fizzing to the top.
4679	contradictory	Overly Orange takes fewer drops to change the color of indophenol so Overly Orange has a higher concentration of vitamin C.	Luscious Lemon contains higher vitamin C. The evidence is that it has more drops so that is the evidence.
1701	correct	Jim would see a clear solution. 3 spoons of solid dissolves, so 2 spoons will dissolve.	It would not have any particles at the bottom.
2669	correct	You can see how much time is taken for the earth materials to move.	In a log it tells how is the canyons, deltas, erosions are happening at times. And it shows what the important times are there.
2334	contradictory	No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.	She can run both at the same time because, if it is going to the negative and to the positive and all the components are set up correctly in the right way it will work.
4488	incorrect	The root grows first so the root can take up water for the plant.	So it can search for food.
378	contradictory	The crystals have different shapes. Salt crystals are square with little Xs. The calcite crystals are shaped like needles (long and skinny).	Because the salt crystals were squares with Xs in them and the calcite crystals were and did not make shapes.
3337	contradictory	There is 30 grams (20 grams plus 10 grams) in the right cup. The balance is tipped down on the ball side which means the ball weighs more than 30 grams. 40 grams is the only weight heavier than 30 grams.	I chose 20 grams because there is 20 grams plus 10 grams 30 grams that way I know how much is it.
1972	correct	If the middle bulb burns out the other 2 bulbs will stay lit.	If the middle one burns out the other will still light.
185	correct	A reaction was indicated by the bubbles of gas (a new material) being produced.	Because it was bubbles and fizzing.
2600	correct	The launch position (line on the playground) is the variable that is controlled.	Where they threw it from.
1330	correct	The harder coin will scratch the other.	By the one that leave a mark on one. That means that that one is harder.
2243	correct	Different girls are throwing the balls. The girls use different launch techniques. Each girl uses a different type of ball.	2 variables that are not controlled in the contest were the amount of steps and what ball they are going to use.
1342	incorrect	The harder coin will scratch the other.	Fire.

3003	correct	The food contains sugar.	That the food had sugar in it and carbon dioxide.
4014	correct	As time increases, the speed of light stays the same (remains constant).	It does not matter how much you give it the speed of light goes just as fast.
4864	correct	Both finger patterns are loops.	The both finer patterns are loop.
4907	correct	She recommended the topographic map because the map shows the elevations along the trail. Pam would know where the trail was the steepest.	Because it would tell you where it is more steep and the elevation and the other one will not.
4179	incorrect	Many tiny bubbles will rise from the calcite when the calcite contacts the cold acid.	Bubbles coming out of the rock and murky water.
1091	incorrect	Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.	Yes. Yes, because she did all the steps she got 2 boxes and wrapped one with white paper and the other with black paper. She punched a hole in each box, stuck a thermometer into each hole and put the boxes in the sun and recorded the temperature in each box.
3097	incorrect	The solid dissolves (seems to disappear) and the liquid remains clear.	When you cannot see the solid.
2282	correct	The fizzing indicates a gas, a new material, is produced. When a new material is produced, a chemical reaction has occurred.	Because fizzing is a sign of gas leaving a material and that is a chemical reaction.
3344	incorrect	There is 30 grams (20 grams plus 10 grams) in the right cup. The balance is tipped down on the ball side which means the ball weighs more than 30 grams. 40 grams is the only weight heavier than 30 grams.	That they ball in the cup and the mass pieces are in this cup. 20 grams plus 10 grams equals 30.
4572	correct	The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.	The clay is deposited where I indicated because it is the lightest.
3810	correct	Shadows change during the day because the Earth is turning. The Sun stays in one place.	Because the sun does not move the earth does.
1169	correct	Yes, aluminum foil is a metal and all metals conduct. The aluminum foil would complete the circuit.	Yes why because aluminum is foil and foil is metal.
945	incorrect	Water heats up faster when covered.	Because it goes to the side and all different ways.

3081	incorrect	A standard is used for comparison to determine how changing one variable changes the results.	Because without a standard you will not know the steps.
2045	correct	If the effort is applied farther from the fulcrum, less effort will lift the load.	When it was closer it was harder and when it was farther away it was easier.
2497	incorrect	That circuit is the only circuit that uses all of the correct contact points.	It is because answer D's wire starts below the light bulb.
910	contradictory	When the string was shorter, the pitch was higher.	The string made a low pitch.

2177	incorrect	The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.	The motor at the right will not run because each one does not have a positive and a negative.
3787	incorrect	Shadows change during the day because the Earth is turning. The Sun stays in one place.	It would best show it because the earth always rotates around the sun.
3206	incorrect	Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.	I think yes because it does not matter how much whatever you put in it and they put the same amount of stuff.
450	incorrect	Earth materials erode and are carried by flowing water (a river). The earth materials form a delta when the materials are dropped off or deposited when the water stops flowing (at the mouth of a river).	Earth materials are carried by water and dropped under the water settling at the bottom of the river.
2598	correct	The launch position (line on the playground) is the variable that is controlled.	They had to throw at a line.
4924	incorrect	She recommended the topographic map because the map shows the elevations along the trail. Pam would know where the trail was the steepest.	Because it is like bird's eye view and so if you look top to bottom you will see almost every detail.
4404	correct	Fruitsnap contains little or no vitamin C so Fruitsnap does not change the color of the indophenol.	Fruitsnap did not change color because it must not have vitamin.
1507	correct	The motor will run.	It will work.
4476	correct	The root grows first so the root can take up water for the plant.	Because the roots go down to the water the leaves go towards the sun.
3186	contradictory	Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.	No, because they do not say how much spoons are in there and 250 milliliters is more concentrated.
684	correct	Use a standard unit of mass like grams.	They should use a standard unit.
1550	correct	If the string is shorter, the pitch will be higher. If the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	Lowest string has the highest pitch. Highest string has the lowest pitch.
1715	incorrect	Jim would see a clear solution. 3 spoons of solid dissolves, so 2 spoons will dissolve.	I think he would see the solid dissolve.

3568	correct	The rubber band vibrates.	When you let go it vibrates.
4489	incorrect	The root grows first so the root can take up water for the plant.	So the root would search for water.
4210	correct	Many tiny bubbles will rise from the calcite when the calcite contacts the cold acid.	The rock would fizz. If it fizzed then there is calcite in it.
2940	incorrect	If gas (carbon dioxide) is produced, the food contains acid. If no gas is produced, the food does not contain acid.	Not much sugar is in the thing she is testing.
2760	incorrect	The elytra are used to make sounds.	Another function is to protect the abdomen.
3610	contradictory	The rubber band vibrates.	Because it hits the top.
1049	incorrect	The marbles used by the 2 groups were probably different masses.	One group did not zero out the balance one did.

1402	correct	There is a complete circuit connecting the bulb to the D-cell battery.	It is a circle.
469	correct	A solution was created when the eggshells disappeared (dissolved) and the mixture ended up as a clear liquid.	Because the eggshells were gone and the water was left, inside was clear that why she thinks that she made a solution.
1376	correct	You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.	Single fixed you can pull down, which does not give you a mechanical advantage. But you do not pull the rope farther than the load.
1020	contradictory	The sand particles are larger and settle first. The flour particles are smaller and therefore settle more slowly.	Because the sand way too heavy when we put in the water, but the flour was the opposite! Because the sand was too heavy to float in the cold acid like the flour.
2737	incorrect	The elytra are used to make sounds.	Horn.
875	correct	When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.	It would not provide useful information because you would not know if either red covered or blue covered absorbed most heat or if red uncovered or blue uncovered absorbed most heat.
3778	correct	Bubbling means a gas has formed. Gas is a new material. A new material indicates a reaction.	Because it was making gas, it was fizzing, it made some precipitant.
2983	correct	The food contains sugar.	That it contains sugar.
4498	correct	The root grows first so the root can take up water for the plant.	Because that is what a plant need to grow. The roots are the part of the plant that sucks up the water.
2740	incorrect	The elytra are used to make sounds.	Protecting the thorax.
3862	incorrect	The loops begin at opposite sides of the print.	Is not the same.
2263	incorrect	The fizzing indicates a gas, a new material, is produced. When a new material is produced, a chemical reaction has occurred.	Because when it fizzing it releases a gas. When a gas forms from 2 materials it is a gas.
4273	correct	Crystals of different materials have different shapes. So the shape will help identify the material.	Whatever the crystals look most like.
4700	contradictory	The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.	Cup B is more concentrated than cup A.
2969	correct	If gas (carbon dioxide) is produced, the food contains acid. If no gas is produced, the food does not contain acid.	Her results will tell her how much acid is in the juice. The more carbon dioxide or gas the more acid it has.
1045	correct	The marbles used by the 2 groups were probably different masses.	Maybe they had bigger marbles than the other team.
1553	correct	If the string is shorter, the pitch will be higher. If the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	When you plucked the shorter string it makes a higher.
1092	incorrect	Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.	Yes. Yes it will because your prediction is based off of what you know and to have data to refer back to you probably will have a more accurate answer.
1117	correct	Seeing multiple colors would show that vinegar can separate the permanent ink.	If she sees different colored pigments.
4535	incorrect	A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.	A. A was the highest because dry soil heats faster.
2016	correct	If the effort is applied farther from the fulcrum, less effort will lift the load.	The farther away from the fulcrum the less effort is needed and the closer to the fulcrum the more effort.
48	correct	Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.	Yes because they are both different.
2881	incorrect	A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.	Because when you use a bigger whole the canyon is deeper and when you have a slope all the water forms a canyon.
4005	incorrect	As time increases, the speed of light stays the same (remains constant).	How fast the speed of light is.
3092	incorrect	The solid dissolves (seems to disappear) and the liquid remains clear.	The solid seems to disappear, or dissolve.
3926	correct	Agree. Vibrations are movements. Vibrations produce sound.	I do agree with her because if a sound is made it vibrates and vibration is back and forth movement and without vibration you can not make a sound.
4088	correct	The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.	The salt is smaller and is harder.
1309	incorrect	Set up evaporation dishes. The water will go into the air (evaporate) and the solid will be left in the dish (crystallize).	He can use a filter.
1324	correct	The harder coin will scratch the other.	Well she can take the penny and the nickel and rub them together.
1022	correct	The sand particles are larger and settle first. The flour particles are smaller and therefore settle more slowly.	Because the sand is heavier than the flour so the sand fell to the bottom before the flour had a chance to fall down and what is heavier falls down faster.
3737	incorrect	The circuit does not include both contact points on the bulb holder, so the electricity can not go through the bulb.	It is in both the same circuit.
1815	incorrect	When less than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the greater the mass of beans harvested. When more than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the less the mass of beans harvested.	It tells me how much Maya used the fertilizer to produce the greatest mass of bean.
4628	incorrect	C. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. Pan C has the most dark surface area so C would heat up the fastest and have the highest temperature.	C. Because it has the most plastic disks.
692	incorrect	Use a standard unit of mass like grams.	Weighed the apple again.
4823	correct	The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.	The more blocks it carried the less farther it would go.

2624	incorrect	The mixtures are all clear.	I think jam is mixture.
2491	incorrect	That circuit is the only circuit that uses all of the correct contact points.	Because the equal part is touching.
3645	incorrect	As time increases, the number of tree rings also increases.	This graph tells me this tree has a lot of rings.
1979	contradictory	You can not tell because we do not know the strength of the magnets. If the magnets are weak, the second piece of foam might put too much distance between the 2 magnets for the interaction to hold the magnets in place. If the magnets are strong the magnets might stay in place.	In example A the magnets stuck. But example B it has 2 blocks and it does not matter if it is thick or thin.
1114	incorrect	Seeing multiple colors would show that vinegar can separate the permanent ink.	Because it is liquid.
883	incorrect	When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.	Because you are comparing 2 thing and it would not make any sense because you know black heats faster than white.
137	incorrect	In the afternoon, shadows point east because the Sun is in the west. So the west side is opposite of the shadows.	West is always on your left, after that it is east.
1703	contradictory	Jim would see a clear solution. 3 spoons of solid dissolves, so 2 spoons will dissolve.	If mixture 3 is dissolved, and mixture one is not dissolved. Mixture 2 will not be dissolved because it is less concentrated than mixture 3.
1261	correct	20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.	The new container would be in the middle of A and B. The temperature would have to be something in between 3 Celsius and 9 Celsius.
4486	correct	The root grows first so the root can take up water for the plant.	To get water for the seed.
1350	correct	The harder coin will scratch the other.	Rub them together and whichever one has a scratch or a mark the is softer and the one that has nothing on it is harder.
3500	correct	Darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors. The dark green sheeting is the darkest color available so she should use the green sheeting.	Dark green because darker colors heat faster they attract the sun.
3260	contradictory	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Nathaniel - Because it is all the same thing.
251	incorrect	The contour lines are closest together at Q.	You can tell because it is at the top and it is 5000.
4230	incorrect	Anna should compare the size of the grease spots. The sample with the larger grease spot has more fat.	Let it sit for a day and if there was a grease spot that is how she would find out.
3942	incorrect	40 meters. The change in elevation is 20 meters between A and B and 20 meters between B and C. So the change between A and C is 40 meters. 20 m plus 20 m equals 40 m.	C, Because it said the change in elevation for A and B was 20 meters and since it 20 they might be counting by 20's so that is my answer.
159	correct	No, Fruity cream cookies are not pure sugar. The cookies did not produce as much gas as was produced by the pure sugar.	They are almost pure sugar because they column tube on the left is above 200 milliliters and the one on the right is below.
1997	contradictory	You can not tell because we do not know the strength of the magnets. If the magnets are weak, the second piece of foam might put too much distance between the 2 magnets for the interaction to hold the magnets in place. If the magnets are strong the magnets might stay in place.	I said the magnets will stick because magnets have really strong magnetic fields and those really strong magnetic fields so they can go through 2 foam blocks.
1476	incorrect	Emily's crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals shown on the key.	You can see it on the pictures.
4460	incorrect	Measure out equal masses of walnuts and peanuts. Smash the samples uniformly in the same size area on brown paper. Wait the same time for each sample.	First you need brown paper indicator weight and one gram block. Take the weight in brown paper indicator and weight one gram. For the peanuts and walnuts on the brown paper and wait 48 hours.
800	incorrect	No, string is an insulator, so the pathway would not be completed.	No it has to hook up to the D-cell.
2454	correct	The circuit is not complete. The electrical pathway is broken.	I chose it because the wire is not connected right to the D-cell.
3606	contradictory	The rubber band vibrates.	It hit the first one.
4084	correct	The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.	Because salt is so small it slid through the large coffee filter. Sand is larger so it stuck to the filter.
1197	incorrect	Bill must have been using degrees Celsius if 28 is a warm temperature.	Nice and warm, about 28 degrees.
4781	correct	The crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals.	Because alum has a hexagon shape.
1312	incorrect	Set up evaporation dishes. The water will go into the air (evaporate) and the solid will be left in the dish (crystallize).	First he could take a wet filter paper, put a clear cup with nothing in it underneath it, then pour the solution through the filter paper.
2944	correct	If gas (carbon dioxide) is produced, the food contains acid. If no gas is produced, the food does not contain acid.	The test results will tell her that the one with sugar has acid. Because it bubbles up.
3382	incorrect	The embryo contains the tiny leaves and root of the plant.	Stem and leaf and baby.
4672	correct	Overly Orange takes fewer drops to change the color of indophenol so Overly Orange has a higher concentration of vitamin C.	Yes, because if it has lower drops it has more vitamin than others.
101	incorrect	Diva needs to know how much gas pure sugar produced in order to decide whether the cookies are pure sugar. Diva needs to make a controlled experiment.	Diva needed to test pure sugar because she needed to see if pure sugar itself had more or less than Fruity Cream cookies.
3464	incorrect	The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.	The triangles are the same size.
82	incorrect	Diva needs to know how much gas pure sugar produced in order to decide whether the cookies are pure sugar. Diva needs to make a controlled experiment.	To see if pure sugar was the same as Fruity Cream cookies.
2756	incorrect	The elytra are used to make sounds.	It scares other animals away.
230	correct	A. The water in Julie's heater got hotter faster (or had a greater temperature change in 20 minutes). The collector in heater A has the greater surface area so the water in A would get hotter faster than the water in B.	A. Box A is laid horizontally. The sun is hitting mostly the top. Box A has a bigger top than box B. Thus making box A hotter.
1260	contradictory	20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.	I think it would be 10 Celsius because it will take the container less time to get hot.
4819	correct	The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.	The more blocks the less it goes.
3422	incorrect	An experiment is controlled if only one variable is changed at a time.	By not being good.
3748	incorrect	The circuit does not include both contact points on the bulb holder, so the electricity can not go through the bulb.	Because the motor got all the power.
4477	incorrect	The root grows first so the root can take up water for the plant.	To gather water for food.
814	correct	No, string is an insulator, so the pathway would not be completed.	You cannot use a piece of string because it has no electricity in it.
2487	correct	That circuit is the only circuit that uses all of the correct contact points.	It is touching both sides of the battery and the light bulb.
2117	incorrect	There is a complete circuit connecting the motor to the D-cell battery.	It can work if a wire is connected to the switch from the negative end.

611	correct	When the string was tighter, the pitch was higher.	The string had a higher pitch.
262	incorrect	The contour lines are closest together at Q.	Because you can see that her lines has the top and it is steeper.
4674	correct	Overly Orange takes fewer drops to change the color of indophenol so Overly Orange has a higher concentration of vitamin C.	Overly Orange then less the drops the more vitamin C.
4385	correct	The shorter the string is, the more the string swings in 15 seconds.  The longer the string is, the less the string swings in 15 seconds.	If the string is made shorter it will swing more. If the string is made longer it will swing less.
4054	incorrect	The crystals were square with Xs on the surface.	Because flour does not turn into crystals.
3195	correct	Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.	Yes, the solutions have the same concentration because, using the same solute and water, there is a saturation point per milliliters of water and they have both reached the saturation point, they are saturated and cannot become any more concentrated, so they are both equally concentrated.
3213	contradictory	Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.	Yes, because they are both saturated and if they add more it will just become more saturated.
174	incorrect	No, Fruity cream cookies are not pure sugar. The cookies did not produce as much gas as was produced by the pure sugar.	Fruity Cream cookies have a lot of pure sugar and the cream cookies have less sugar.
3807	incorrect	Shadows change during the day because the Earth is turning. The Sun stays in one place.	Because the earth now rotates around the sun and at different time of the day you shadow will move.
3443	incorrect	The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.	They both are the same size, have the same water amount, and are left out for the same time.
273	incorrect	The contour lines are closest together at Q.	The lines are closer together.
2376	correct	The salt crystals are squares with Xs on top.	Square with X in it.
4511	contradictory	A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.	B. dry soil heats up faster than water because dry soil is like sand gets hot fast.
3505	correct	The seed coat protects the seed until the plant begins to grow.	To protect the baby seed.
4381	correct	The shorter the string is, the more the string swings in 15 seconds.  The longer the string is, the less the string swings in 15 seconds.	Well if the string is long it swings less times but if it is short it swings more times.
3190	contradictory	Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.	No they do not because they are not the same amount of water and it will not equal the same.
1902	correct	Earth materials settle out during deposition.	It goes to a different place.
3693	incorrect	Fabric A is smoother and has a finer texture. Fabric B is rougher and has a coarser texture.	A is harder to read than B.
1024	contradictory	The sand particles are larger and settle first. The flour particles are smaller and therefore settle more slowly.	By dissolving and in water the sand moves around in it.
895	correct	When the string was shorter, the pitch was higher.	Which side has more string is a lower pitch. Whichever side has more string it has a lower pitch.
4188	incorrect	Many tiny bubbles will rise from the calcite when the calcite contacts the cold acid.	I would look for bubbles if the it has bubble it has calcite.
519	incorrect	The saxophone has the longest and fattest tube.	Because the lower it is the lower for big.
797	incorrect	No, string is an insulator, so the pathway would not be completed.	No, because it is made of thread.
3447	contradictory	The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.	I chose less than because X is a little bit more smaller.
2209	incorrect	All variables except the girl need to be held constant (controlled). The girls all need to throw the same ball and use the same launch technique.	Use all of the same balls.
3587	correct	The rubber band vibrates.	By the vibrations.

4276	incorrect	Crystals of different materials have different shapes. So the shape will help identify the material.	He will know because he will see stuff at the bottom.
3971	incorrect	The cotyledon provides food for the plant until the plant can make food for itself.	To store the food, nutrients.
4263	incorrect	Crystals of different materials have different shapes. So the shape will help identify the material.	Because no 2 crystals are the same.
1329	correct	The harder coin will scratch the other.	In order to tell which is harder, else would have to see if the penny and nickel leave a mark to see which is harder.
4172	incorrect	The water was evaporated, leaving the salt.	I do not know.
1641	correct	The water splashed because the fork was vibrating. Vibrations make sounds.	It helped Mary understand that the tuning fork makes sounds by vibrating because the water splashed.
557	correct	Use a standard unit of measurement such as centimeters or meters.	She could use measuring tape and see how much is it.
1118	correct	Seeing multiple colors would show that vinegar can separate the permanent ink.	She would see if there is different pigment in the color.
3095	incorrect	The solid dissolves (seems to disappear) and the liquid remains clear.	Then material will probably split up into smaller parts.
615	correct	When the string was tighter, the pitch was higher.	The pitch higher so it was more of a ding than a bring.
3261	incorrect	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Sammy - Because you need difference thing.
730	correct	In the morning the Sun is in the east so shadows point west. In the afternoon the Sun is in the west so shadows point east.	The bus stop's shadow was facing the opposite direction because in the morning the sun rises from the east and the shadow was facing west. The sun sets in the west and so the shadow is facing east.
4925	correct	She recommended the topographic map because the map shows the elevations along the trail. Pam would know where the trail was the steepest.	She recommended it because it informs them how many feet it increases. Also it shows you more locations so they know if they cross someplace they have gone too far.
323	correct	Greta and Andre have different sized hands.	Maybe Andre's hand is bigger than Greta's hand.
2900	incorrect	A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.	My choices cause more erosion because if you have a bigger hole more water can pour through and if the slope is steeper water will come down harder.
2994	correct	The food contains sugar.	It indicates a sugar test to see how much sugar there is.
2575	incorrect	The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.	Because it is a cinematic circuit.
1829	correct	The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.	The solid was too big to go through the filter paper.
2620	correct	The launch position (line on the playground) is the variable that is controlled.	The lines.
2092	incorrect	There is a complete circuit connecting the motor to the D-cell battery.	Because the light bulb is on the right.
2353	incorrect	If the key sticks, the key is iron; if the key does not stick the key is aluminum.	The magnet will stick.
4207	incorrect	Many tiny bubbles will rise from the calcite when the calcite contacts the cold acid.	Water breaks rock to little pieces.
46	correct	Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.	Yes because the solubility is of mixtures are not all the same.
4357	incorrect	2: Trace the features from the photograph onto the overlay grid. 4: Transfer the features to the matching squares on the smaller grid in your notebook.	2. Draw it smaller than it really is. 4. Take a farther away picture so it is small enough so it can fit in your notebooks.
4317	incorrect	Wendy should hook one end of the wire to the negative side of a D-cell battery and the other end to the positive side of the D-cell battery.	She would need a switch then she would turn on the switch she would also need a D-cell.
217	correct	A. The water in Julie's heater got hotter faster (or had a greater temperature change in 20 minutes). The collector in heater A has the greater surface area so the water in A would get hotter faster than the water in B.	A. Julie's box had more black so the box was hotter because the more black the more the heat the black absorb. So that is why I chose Julie's because in my graph hers was the highest.
659	correct	Solar water heaters with blue collectors heat up faster than solar water heaters with red collectors.	It tells me that the blue is winning and not the red.
2218	incorrect	All variables except the girl need to be held constant (controlled). The girls all need to throw the same ball and use the same launch technique.	They should all start in the line.
4776	correct	The crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals.	Because the picture that Emily drew looks just like the alum in the crystal sheet key and they are both the same shape and have the same pattern.
3162	correct	During a flood there is more water in the creek and the water flows faster.	The water flows quickly during floods and also the water is high and normal water flows pretty calm and is not usually as high as water is during floods.
4257	incorrect	Crystals of different materials have different shapes. So the shape will help identify the material.	I going to put salt and water and leave it for some days and it is going to turn into crystals.
4617	correct	C. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. Pan C has the most dark surface area so C would heat up the fastest and have the highest temperature.	C. Since more surface area absorbs heat and it was black it makes more sense for it to be more hot.
4904	incorrect	She recommended the topographic map because the map shows the elevations along the trail. Pam would know where the trail was the steepest.	To see a bird's eye view which is better view than looking from land.
4709	incorrect	The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.	Because he took the same amount from each bottle.
713	correct	In the morning the Sun is in the east so shadows point west. In the afternoon the Sun is in the west so shadows point east.	In the morning the sun faced east so the bus sign's shadow was in the west. When it was the afternoon, the sun faced west. So the shadow went the opposite of where it used to be in the morning.
4074	correct	The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.	Because the salt was too small so small that you cannot see it.
328	correct	Greta and Andre have different sized hands.	Greta had a smaller hand than him.
4320	correct	Wendy should hook one end of the wire to the negative side of a D-cell battery and the other end to the positive side of the D-cell battery.	Connect the wires to a battery or power source.
3886	correct	The loops begin at opposite sides of the print.	The loops are coming from different sides.
600	incorrect	The motor will continue to run because the motor still has a pathway to the D-cell.	The motor is going to keep going when the light bulb goes out.
3643	incorrect	The rubber band vibrates.	So it could a sound.
4193	incorrect	Many tiny bubbles will rise from the calcite when the calcite contacts the cold acid.	You will see bubbles coming up and you will see them going fast.
2975	incorrect	If gas (carbon dioxide) is produced, the food contains acid. If no gas is produced, the food does not contain acid.	That is how much acid or sugar it has.
2365	correct	If the key sticks, the key is iron; if the key does not stick the key is aluminum.	Because if it sticked it was iron if it did not it is aluminum.
1795	correct	When less than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the greater the mass of beans harvested. When more than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the less the mass of beans harvested.	If you use anything under 3 scoops you will not get your greatest mass. If you use anything over 3 scoops you will also not get your greatest mass.
3093	contradictory	The solid dissolves (seems to disappear) and the liquid remains clear.	Well I will see the solid at the bottom and the liquid on top of it.

4058	incorrect	The crystals were square with Xs on the surface.	By looking at the crystal identification sheet.
1651	correct	If the motor runs, the object is a conductor.	The motor will run that is how you will know.
4691	contradictory	The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.	Because now there is now only some of water in each and 4 is more than 2 and cup B more concentration.
4481	correct	The root grows first so the root can take up water for the plant.	So it can gather water to grow.
2372	incorrect	The salt crystals are squares with Xs on top.	It look like feathers.
1868	correct	A car is made of a lot of iron or steel.	It is iron or steel.
3642	incorrect	The rubber band vibrates.	Sound like Pum!
4013	contradictory	As time increases, the speed of light stays the same (remains constant).	This graph tells you how fast the speed of light travels in a certain amount of time.
969	correct	The brass ring would not stick to the nail because the ring is not iron. The nail is a temporary magnet, but brass cannot become a temporary magnet and thus does not stick to magnets.	Fall off because they have no iron in them.
4632	incorrect	C. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. Pan C has the most dark surface area so C would heat up the fastest and have the highest temperature.	C. Well it has more black, and the sun's heat is attracted by dark colors, so the heat would stay on C.
3399	correct	An experiment is controlled if only one variable is changed at a time.	A controlled experiment is an experiment where only one variable is changed.
3844	correct	So people know exactly what the measurement means. A standard is necessary so everyone measures using the same unit and everyone gets the same measurement.	Because if you use paperclips that would be wrong because they come in different sizes. And if you use your hand it will also be wrong because you hand could be big or small.
1067	incorrect	The marbles used by the 2 groups were probably different masses.	They do not have the same number.
1243	incorrect	Lee should put one of the loose wires on one part of the object and the other loose wire on another part of the object and see if the object completes the circuit.	Put it on something metal or a screw or a desk.
1224	incorrect	Lee should put one of the loose wires on one part of the object and the other loose wire on another part of the object and see if the object completes the circuit.	You can touch those 2 wires together to contract electricity.
3428	incorrect	An experiment is controlled if only one variable is changed at a time.	You controlled the experiment by yourself.
1840	correct	The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.	Because the materials are too big to go through the holes but the water is not too big to go through the holes in the filter.
4779	incorrect	The crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals.	Because Alum looks like that.
753	incorrect	X. When equal amounts of 2 solutions are compared, the solution that is more concentrated will have the greater mass (weigh more). 50 milliliters of X has a greater mass than 50 milliliters of Y, so X must be more concentrated.	X, because x is more heavier than cup y.
3014	correct	The cotyledon provides food for the plant to begin growing.	Feeds the embryo.
270	incorrect	The contour lines are closest together at Q.	I know because the contour lines are closer together.
3732	incorrect	The circuit does not include both contact points on the bulb holder, so the electricity can not go through the bulb.	The battery does not have enough power or the power is not getting to the bulb.
456	correct	Earth materials erode and are carried by flowing water (a river). The earth materials form a delta when the materials are dropped off or deposited when the water stops flowing (at the mouth of a river).	Sand gets carried away by the river and settles at the mouth and forms a delta.
1669	correct	If the motor runs, the object is a conductor.	The object will go.
2390	correct	The salt crystals are squares with Xs on top.	Squares with the Xs on them.
387	incorrect	The crystals have different shapes. Salt crystals are square with little Xs. The calcite crystals are shaped like needles (long and skinny).	The one has Xs is the one look like sauce.
1147	contradictory	Yes, aluminum foil is a metal and all metals conduct. The aluminum foil would complete the circuit.	No, because it is not made out of metal.
4699	incorrect	The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.	They are going to be even.
758	incorrect	X. When equal amounts of 2 solutions are compared, the solution that is more concentrated will have the greater mass (weigh more). 50 milliliters of X has a greater mass than 50 milliliters of Y, so X must be more concentrated.	X, how I know is because concentrated means the heaviest.
663	correct	Solar water heaters with blue collectors heat up faster than solar water heaters with red collectors.	That blue must be darker soil will absorb more than the red.
2565	incorrect	The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.	That happens because they each have their own circuit.
4803	correct	The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.	The relationship is it goes down one every time you add a block.
4071	incorrect	The crystals were square with Xs on the surface.	Because we looked in the magnifying glass.
865	correct	When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.	Maybe the blue uncovered would be the same as the red or not, just to make sure.
1734	incorrect	The bulb will light.	It will turn on.
832	contradictory	A solution is a mixture formed when a solid dissolves in a liquid.	A solution is different from a mixture because it is when you mix 2 or more things and a solution is when like water and salt dissolves or evaporated.

The one with a larger grease spot has more fat.
4552	correct	The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.	It is deposited the farthest because it is lighter than the other ones.
1305	contradictory	Set up evaporation dishes. The water will go into the air (evaporate) and the solid will be left in the dish (crystallize).	He could filter out the dissolved with a dry filter. And the water will be in its own cup.
2445	correct	The circuit is not complete. The electrical pathway is broken.	Because it got half of it cut off so you cannot make it go back and forth.
4505	incorrect	A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.	A. The graph helped me because the dry soil gets hot. The one that gets hot between water and dry soil is dry soil. The soil gets hotter because it absorbs more heat.
3733	incorrect	The circuit does not include both contact points on the bulb holder, so the electricity can not go through the bulb.	The motor is not running.
281	incorrect	The contour lines are closest together at Q.	Q because the place it is located.

4578	correct	Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.	I chose A because in each cup you could put 4 spoons and it dissolved. When the fifth scoop went in it did not dissolve. The undissolved part is not part of the solution.
492	incorrect	A solution was created when the eggshells disappeared (dissolved) and the mixture ended up as a clear liquid.	Because there were more bubbles everyday.
3258	incorrect	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Sammy - Because wood blocks of different shapes and sizes would sound the same so Sammy's is better.
4684	contradictory	The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.	Because you would have to take 50 milliliters of water out of cup B or else cup B would be heavier. So it would more fair.
841	incorrect	A solution is a mixture formed when a solid dissolves in a liquid.	Other mixtures are mixed with peas and tomatoes and other foods.

1078	incorrect	Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.	Yes. Black is hotter than the white box because black gets hotter fast.
710	incorrect	In the morning the Sun is in the east so shadows point west. In the afternoon the Sun is in the west so shadows point east.	I think that Betty was a best shadow that was facing the opposite direction.
295	correct	The boat with 0 marbles is the standard in this experiment.	The standard is 0 marbles and 0 the boat sank.
4426	correct	Fruitsnap contains little or no vitamin C so Fruitsnap does not change the color of the indophenol.	Because Fruitsnap had little or no vitamin C.
3566	incorrect	The rubber band vibrates.	It makes noise.
2607	incorrect	The launch position (line on the playground) is the variable that is controlled.	Throwing the ball.
4340	incorrect	2: Trace the features from the photograph onto the overlay grid. 4: Transfer the features to the matching squares on the smaller grid in your notebook.	2. Trace over the objects on the model. Only trace the outline of the objects. 4. Redraw the traced figures on your small grid.
3493	incorrect	Darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors. The dark green sheeting is the darkest color available so she should use the green sheeting.	I chose that answer because yellow reflects heat and dark stuff keep heat.

1736	correct	The bulb will light.	The light bulb will cut on.
616	contradictory	When the string was tighter, the pitch was higher.	Lower because if you pull on the string it is lower.
2211	incorrect	All variables except the girl need to be held constant (controlled). The girls all need to throw the same ball and use the same launch technique.	First they all do the standard way then they throw the same ball and write then they do that again 2 times with the other balls then finally they write it and compare.
3466	correct	The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.	Because they are the same size and same color so it is going to be the same temperature.

3575	contradictory	The rubber band vibrates.	If you have something close to the rubber band it would hit it and make noise.
759	incorrect	X. When equal amounts of 2 solutions are compared, the solution that is more concentrated will have the greater mass (weigh more). 50 milliliters of X has a greater mass than 50 milliliters of Y, so X must be more concentrated.	X, I know because when a solution has more solid, has a better taste, or weighs more it is more concentrated than the other one.
4023	incorrect	As time increases, the speed of light stays the same (remains constant).	As light turns itself it will move.
1609	incorrect	The tree blocks the light from the Sun.	The tree has a shadow because there is a sun.
4138	incorrect	Water will always flow downhill (mountain to valley).	The river gets the water from the mountain and takes it to happy valley.
954	correct	Water heats up faster when covered.	It gets hot faster with covered because when water starts to get hot no air comes in it starts to get hotter.
2465	correct	The circuit is not complete. The electrical pathway is broken.	I chose no because it is not a complete circuit.
3449	correct	The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.	Same, because they are the same size triangles and in the same size boxes, with the same amount of water.
1401	correct	There is a complete circuit connecting the bulb to the D-cell battery.	It will happen because the motor and the bulb are not connected on the same wires.
649	incorrect	Solar water heaters with blue collectors heat up faster than solar water heaters with red collectors.	That the blue might be darker than the red.
862	correct	When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.	It would not be useful because red is uncovered and blue is covered and it is not fair.
2206	incorrect	All variables except the girl need to be held constant (controlled). The girls all need to throw the same ball and use the same launch technique.	The girls needed to change each variable at a time, like starting at the same position, all 3 of them, and the mass of the balls.
4738	incorrect	When the string is tighter, the pitch will be higher.	The string gets higher.
4468	correct	The root grows first so the root can take up water for the plant.	Because it sucks up the water as food for the plant and stem.
1892	incorrect	A car is made of a lot of iron or steel.	The car hood can trigger the light to change.
4928	correct	She recommended the topographic map because the map shows the elevations along the trail. Pam would know where the trail was the steepest.	Pam's friend recommend the topographic map so she can tell which side is steeper. It also shows the elevations for the height.
3766	correct	Bubbling means a gas has formed. Gas is a new material. A new material indicates a reaction.	He knew because first he put a material in the water and started to bubble and that made gas so that is a clue of a chemical reaction.
3761	incorrect	Bubbling means a gas has formed. Gas is a new material. A new material indicates a reaction.	Because whenever it fizzes or bubbles that means it is a reaction.
388	incorrect	The crystals have different shapes. Salt crystals are square with little Xs. The calcite crystals are shaped like needles (long and skinny).	Calcite crystals, salt crystals, acid, vinegar.
3189	contradictory	Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.	No, because one has more water.
3333	contradictory	There is 30 grams (20 grams plus 10 grams) in the right cup. The balance is tipped down on the ball side which means the ball weighs more than 30 grams. 40 grams is the only weight heavier than 30 grams.	Because if you have a 20 mass piece and a 10 mass piece you have 40 grams all together.
1801	incorrect	When less than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the greater the mass of beans harvested. When more than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the less the mass of beans harvested.	It tells me that the more water she puts in the plant the heavier it is.
2346	correct	If the key sticks, the key is iron; if the key does not stick the key is aluminum.	You could get something with magnitite in it and see if it sticks if it sticks you know it is iron if it does not stick it is aluminum.
2370	incorrect	If the key sticks, the key is iron; if the key does not stick the key is aluminum.	It will fall off the magnet.
2887	incorrect	A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.	Steep slopes can have landslides, faster water can gush. To be a flood plus massively erode.
2309	incorrect	No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.	No she cannot. She would have to turn the switch like this sideways Because there is a gap if you turn it left or right.
882	correct	When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.	It would not tell the difference if blue is warmer the red or uncover heat up slower than cover.
3285	incorrect	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Sammy - Because they are different things so you can tell what they are because they are different and just wood kind of makes the same sound.
2558	correct	The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.	Because the bulbs are in parallel circuit.
3048	incorrect	A standard is used for comparison to determine how changing one variable changes the results.	You use a standard so you will not make a mistake and so you can compare it to differences.
3762	correct	Bubbling means a gas has formed. Gas is a new material. A new material indicates a reaction.	Because the bubbles appear it makes a gas.
200	correct	A reaction was indicated by the bubbles of gas (a new material) being produced.	Because she saw bubbles.
2162	incorrect	The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.	It is go out the wrong way.
2040	correct	If the effort is applied farther from the fulcrum, less effort will lift the load.	The distance matters in this experiment. The closer the effort is to the fulcrum, the more effort it takes to lift the fulcrum.
3251	contradictory	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Nathaniel - Because plastic and metal make different noises than just wood.
2181	incorrect	The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.	It will not work because it is dead battery.
246	correct	A. The water in Julie's heater got hotter faster (or had a greater temperature change in 20 minutes). The collector in heater A has the greater surface area so the water in A would get hotter faster than the water in B.	A. Julie made box A because her temperatures were high. Box A has more black than box B. So box A will absorb more heat since it has more black.
1580	incorrect	The tree blocks the light from the Sun.	In the early afternoon it would look point, north east.
2847	correct	Put acid on a rock. If the acid fizzes, Phil would know that the rock has calcite.	He should put vinegar in the vial and put then rock inside and look for bubbles.

2933	correct	The mirror would complete the image of the object and make the object appear whole.	You would see the same object.
857	incorrect	When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.	Maybe because they are each different types.
2610	correct	The launch position (line on the playground) is the variable that is controlled.	How they stood in the line, and how far they are.
198	correct	A reaction was indicated by the bubbles of gas (a new material) being produced.	It was a slow reaction but when it started to bubble and the shell dissolved it was a reaction.
3583	correct	The rubber band vibrates.	When you let it go you can see it make a vibration that makes the sound.
4658	correct	Overly Orange takes fewer drops to change the color of indophenol so Overly Orange has a higher concentration of vitamin C.	Overly Orange had the most vitamin C because it does not use the most amount of drops.
4274	incorrect	Crystals of different materials have different shapes. So the shape will help identify the material.	He can compare them with other crystals he can make and that will tell him.
1802	incorrect	When less than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the greater the mass of beans harvested. When more than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the less the mass of beans harvested.

853	incorrect	A solution is a mixture formed when a solid dissolves in a liquid.	They have a different type of them that they have different ideas.
1354	incorrect	You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.	It is harder to use this system than to use a single fixed pulley system.
3167	incorrect	During a flood there is more water in the creek and the water flows faster.	A creek usually flows slowly and floods usually flow quickly.
1635	correct	The water splashed because the fork was vibrating. Vibrations make sounds.	The vibrations are like digging in the water and make a sound zzzzz!
3608	correct	The rubber band vibrates.	Because it is vibrating.
3244	incorrect	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Sammy - Because Sammy's idea would be easier than Nathaniel's idea.

2499	correct	That circuit is the only circuit that uses all of the correct contact points.	Because they are going in a complete circuit.
3179	incorrect	During a flood there is more water in the creek and the water flows faster.	The water overlaps the area around the creek during a flood.
41	correct	Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.	Yes because the water has different materials in it and the materials have different atoms and stuff and that makes changes to what happens to them in water and their solubility.
2313	contradictory	No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.	Yes because the motor is sending the energy back to the light bulb and back.
2880	correct	A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.	I chose source with a bigger hole and make the slope steeper because the hole would make the water come out more with water to make slope steeper because so the water will get more speed and to make more erosion.
1253	incorrect	20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.	Because X 10 minute with 2 Y.
2395	incorrect	The salt crystals are squares with Xs on top.	The salt was made of crystals because crystals have Xs.

1990	correct	You can not tell because we do not know the strength of the magnets. If the magnets are weak, the second piece of foam might put too much distance between the 2 magnets for the interaction to hold the magnets in place. If the magnets are strong the magnets might stay in place.	It might stick because the magnets are strong or it might not because the foam could be too thick.
740	incorrect	In the morning the Sun is in the east so shadows point west. In the afternoon the Sun is in the west so shadows point east.	It is the different time of the day.
1780	incorrect	The harder mineral will leave a scratch on the less hard mineral. If the black mineral is harder, the brown mineral will have a scratch.	The one that does not break.
4641	incorrect	C. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. Pan C has the most dark surface area so C would heat up the fastest and have the highest temperature.	C. Because the pan has more disks but they also are small so they would heat up easily.
2006	incorrect	You can not tell because we do not know the strength of the magnets. If the magnets are weak, the second piece of foam might put too much distance between the 2 magnets for the interaction to hold the magnets in place.

4865	correct	Both finger patterns are loops.	They are same loop.
70	incorrect	Diva needs to know how much gas pure sugar produced in order to decide whether the cookies are pure sugar. Diva needs to make a controlled experiment.	Diva needed to test pure sugar because that is how much she is eating with the cookies. So it is not good to have too much or else she will have diabetes.
138	contradictory	In the afternoon, shadows point east because the Sun is in the west. So the west side is opposite of the shadows.	I know which direction was west is because a shadow facing west.
4133	incorrect	Water will always flow downhill (mountain to valley).	I think that way, because the water will flow down the mountain, not up it.
4081	incorrect	The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.	The salt did not get caught because it dissolved in the water.
1019	incorrect	The sand particles are larger and settle first. The flour particles are smaller and therefore settle more slowly.	Because sand is heavier than flour.
2003	contradictory	You can not tell because we do not know the strength of the magnets. If the magnets are weak, the second piece of foam might put too much distance between the 2 magnets for the interaction to hold the magnets in place. If the magnets are strong the magnets might stay in place.	The foam blocks are thick so the magnetism will not be able to go through.
1429	correct	Rub the minerals together and see which one scratches the other.	Scratch them against each other.
1716	incorrect	Jim would see a clear solution. 3 spoons of solid dissolves, so 2 spoons will dissolve.	Mixture 2 maybe clear with nothing on the bottom.
4094	correct	The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.	Because the filter has smaller holes so whatever big particle will be separated.
816	incorrect	No, string is an insulator, so the pathway would not be completed.	No because the string is not a wire.
3029	incorrect	The cotyledon provides food for the plant to begin growing.	Food storage.

314	incorrect	The boat with 0 marbles is the standard in this experiment.	Jack changed the number of marbles.
454	incorrect	Earth materials erode and are carried by flowing water (a river). The earth materials form a delta when the materials are dropped off or deposited when the water stops flowing (at the mouth of a river).	Deltas are formed by water carrying earth materials and not have enough force to push the materials so it lets the materials go.
627	correct	When the string was tighter, the pitch was higher.	When the string is tightened the string comes more out of the guitar part so the string in the guitar part is smaller so the pitch it higher.

3432	correct	An experiment is controlled if only one variable is changed at a time.	A controlled experiment is when you only change one variable at a time.
746	contradictory	X. When equal amounts of 2 solutions are compared, the solution that is more concentrated will have the greater mass (weigh more). 50 milliliters of X has a greater mass than 50 milliliters of Y, so X must be more concentrated.	Y, y because it have to be less.
3694	incorrect	Fabric A is smoother and has a finer texture. Fabric B is rougher and has a coarser texture.	One of the rubbings are smooth and the other one looks rough.
2966	incorrect	If gas (carbon dioxide) is produced, the food contains acid. If no gas is produced, the food does not contain acid.	The results would tell her how much sugar, carbon dioxide, there is in the bag.
4459	incorrect	Measure out equal masses of walnuts and peanuts. Smash the samples uniformly in the same size area on brown paper. Wait the same time for each sample.	First you will need 2 cups, a scale, brown paper indicator food, and the same size circle on brown paper, one gram fat the cups on the scale then put the paper on the cups. Put the one gram on one side and the food on the other side, the scale must be even. After you did that with both foods keep the food on the brown paper for 2 days. After 2 days the one with the bigger grease spot is the one with the most fat in it.
3317	correct	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Sammy - Sammy's idea is much easier because the method is made of metal, wood, plastic. But Nathaniel is all wood, even though the shapes are different it would be the same sound and will be complicated for Sammy to guess. So I think Sammy's idea is much easier.
3834	correct	So people know exactly what the measurement means. A standard is necessary so everyone measures using the same unit and everyone gets the same measurement.	So everyone would get the same answers. It is the same for everybody.
4507	incorrect	A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.	A. Dry soil cools faster than water.

601	incorrect	The motor will continue to run because the motor still has a pathway to the D-cell.	It will still run.
2490	correct	That circuit is the only circuit that uses all of the correct contact points.	Because there is a full circuit.
2233	incorrect	Different girls are throwing the balls. The girls use different launch techniques. Each girl uses a different type of ball.	The same kind of balls. Having a running start.
177	correct	A reaction was indicated by the bubbles of gas (a new material) being produced.	Because after a while small bubbles appeared, but in the next day, bubbles, starting to be more eggshells were disappeared.
4415	correct	Fruitsnap contains little or no vitamin C so Fruitsnap does not change the color of the indophenol.	It did not work because it has no vitamin C.
4607	incorrect	Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.	Cup one has less material on the bottom.
3487	correct	Darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors. The dark green sheeting is the darkest color available so she should use the green sheeting.	I choose B because if you use a light color the solar energy will reflect off it if you use a dark color it will absorb the solar energy.
2655	incorrect	The mixtures are all clear.	One spoon.
1924	incorrect	Earth materials settle out during deposition.	The earth materials that have been eroded is deposited at the mouth of a river or stream forming a delta.
3820	contradictory	Shadows change during the day because the Earth is turning. The Sun stays in one place.	Because if you rotate the globe it does not do anything. When you move the flashlight the shadow and that is why I pick move the flashlight.
2619	correct	The launch position (line on the playground) is the variable that is controlled.	The line.
1304	incorrect	Set up evaporation dishes. The water will go into the air (evaporate) and the solid will be left in the dish (crystallize).	Jim could evaporate the solution.
236	correct	A. The water in Julie's heater got hotter faster (or had a greater temperature change in 20 minutes). The collector in heater A has the greater surface area so the water in A would get hotter faster than the water in B.	A. The evidence that supports my answer is that box A had more black in it and the sun would absorb box A more.
4795	incorrect	The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.	Once he added one more the mass was slower and that is what he showed on the graph.
4300	incorrect	Wendy should hook one end of the wire to the negative side of a D-cell battery and the other end to the positive side of the D-cell battery.	Wendy, you should have a D-cell or a D-cell it does not matter. And a switch if you want it to work.
2192	correct	All variables except the girl need to be held constant (controlled). The girls all need to throw the same ball and use the same launch technique.	They need to use the same ball and they need to throw the same way.
1061	incorrect	The marbles used by the 2 groups were probably different masses.	Different sized marbles.
2996	incorrect	The food contains sugar.	It indicates carbon dioxide.
1763	correct	The harder mineral will leave a scratch on the less hard mineral. If the black mineral is harder, the brown mineral will have a scratch.	She can rub the scratch. If it goes away, the black one is harder. If it stays there, the brown one is harder.
1335	correct	The harder coin will scratch the other.	You get a penny or a nickel if one of them scratches the metal it is hard.
2384	correct	The salt crystals are squares with Xs on top.	Organized cubes with X.
561	correct	Use a standard unit of measurement such as centimeters or meters.	With a centimeters tape.
2931	incorrect	The mirror would complete the image of the object and make the object appear whole.	You would see the opposite face of the shape.
4540	incorrect	The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.	The clay is like wet sand and it is by the river.
282	correct	The contour lines are closest together at Q.	Q is on the steepest part of the trail. I know this because the lines are closer together.
287	incorrect	The boat with 0 marbles is the standard in this experiment.	To is boat.
628	correct	When the string was tighter, the pitch was higher.	When she tightened the string there was a higher pitch.

1684	incorrect	If the motor runs, the object is a conductor.	Check if is right or not.
141	correct	No, Fruity cream cookies are not pure sugar. The cookies did not produce as much gas as was produced by the pure sugar.	No, because with pure sugar is higher than 200 milliliters and Fruity Cream cookies is 150 milliliters.
3828	correct	So people know exactly what the measurement means. A standard is necessary so everyone measures using the same unit and everyone gets the same measurement.	If you do not use one you and your partner will not get accurate answers.
2230	correct	Different girls are throwing the balls. The girls use different launch techniques. Each girl uses a different type of ball.	Size of ball because they all should have used the same ball, where to start they should have all stood in the same spot.
506	contradictory	The saxophone has the longest and fattest tube.	Because it is the smallest.
3729	incorrect	The circuit does not include both contact points on the bulb holder, so the electricity can not go through the bulb.	It is not connected properly because the wires are not connected properly on the motor.
4382	correct	The shorter the string is, the more the string swings in 15 seconds.  The longer the string is, the less the string swings in 15 seconds.	If the swinger is smaller it will swing faster if it was longer it will swing slower, If it is really really long it will only swing 5 times.
371	incorrect	The crystals have different shapes. Salt crystals are square with little Xs. The calcite crystals are shaped like needles (long and skinny).	The salt crystals have Xs and the others do not.
3182	incorrect	During a flood there is more water in the creek and the water flows faster.	It is compared to different speed a flow patterns.
2841	incorrect	Put acid on a rock. If the acid fizzes, Phil would know that the rock has calcite.	Because vinegar is cold acid is very into now.
3026	incorrect	The cotyledon provides food for the plant to begin growing.	Where seeds are.
1317	incorrect	Set up evaporation dishes. The water will go into the air (evaporate) and the solid will be left in the dish (crystallize).	He could put it through a filter and then he would be able to see the crystals.
4845	incorrect	When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.	The magnetism force flows through the paperclips.
3425	incorrect	An experiment is controlled if only one variable is changed at a time.	Something that you do and you control.
683	correct	Use a standard unit of mass like grams.	They should use grams instead.
431	incorrect	Earth materials erode and are carried by flowing water (a river). The earth materials form a delta when the materials are dropped off or deposited when the water stops flowing (at the mouth of a river).	A erosion happen and over the time it forms.
4028	contradictory	As time increases, the speed of light stays the same (remains constant).	As time goes on it gets more speed.
3326	incorrect	There is 30 grams (20 grams plus 10 grams) in the right cup. The balance is tipped down on the ball side which means the ball weighs more than 30 grams. 40 grams is the only weight heavier than 30 grams.	He can use is volume because he can use it.
1271	correct	20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.	Well, 20 centimeters long is in between water heaters A and B, so I looked at their heating temperature between the 2 at 10 minutes then I would estimate what that middle number would be. And it is 6 Celsius.
619	contradictory	When the string was tighter, the pitch was higher.	It is lower pitch when it is tighten so if it is looser then it is high pitch.
4347	incorrect	2: Trace the features from the photograph onto the overlay grid. 4: Transfer the features to the matching squares on the smaller grid in your notebook.	2. He can get a smaller picture of his neighbor.
4799	incorrect	The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.	One shows the number of blocks and one shows the distance of how far they went.
4790	correct	The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.	As the blocks increase the distance decreases.
3960	correct	40 meters. The change in elevation is 20 meters between A and B and 20 meters between B and C. So the change between A and C is 40 meters. 20 m plus 20 m equals 40 m.	40 meters, I know this because contour intervals do not change and 20 plus 20 equals 40.
4414	correct	Fruitsnap contains little or no vitamin C so Fruitsnap does not change the color of the indophenol.	It did not because it had no vitamin C or a little bit of vitamin C.
4585	contradictory	Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.	Because it has more spoons of solute but it has the same amount of water.
194	correct	A reaction was indicated by the bubbles of gas (a new material) being produced.	Because she use eggshells and vinegar then small bubbles appeared then there were more bubbles the eggshells turned into a liquid.
1115	incorrect	Seeing multiple colors would show that vinegar can separate the permanent ink.	She will have to try it out.
1051	incorrect	The marbles used by the 2 groups were probably different masses.	Bigger grams.
1975	incorrect	You can not tell because we do not know the strength of the magnets. If the magnets are weak, the second piece of foam might put too much distance between the 2 magnets for the interaction to hold the magnets in place. If the magnets are strong the magnets might stay in place.	I chose because that is the answer.
2137	incorrect	A chemical reaction occurred. [The white solid is a precipitate (a new material) which indicates the reaction.]	That white solid indicates a precipitate.
296	correct	The boat with 0 marbles is the standard in this experiment.	The cup that did not hold anything.
4890	correct	Both finger patterns are loops.	Both of the finger points have a loop.
348	correct	Greta and Andre have different sized hands.	They got different measurements because Andre has bigger hands than Greta.
3498	contradictory	Darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors. The dark green sheeting is the darkest color available so she should use the green sheeting.	A dark color can be reflected by the sun and it could heat up the wading pool's water.
330	correct	Greta and Andre have different sized hands.	Maybe she had bigger hands.
2190	correct	The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.	The electricity is flowing from a positive to a positive end, when the negative should give the electricity to the motor and back to a positive end.
1760	correct	The harder mineral will leave a scratch on the less hard mineral. If the black mineral is harder, the brown mineral will have a scratch.	See which one scratched the other.
3593	correct	The rubber band vibrates.	Because it is vibrating.
3198	contradictory	Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.	No because one has more water which will make the solution heavier than the other.
468	correct	A solution was created when the eggshells disappeared (dissolved) and the mixture ended up as a clear liquid.	She made a solution because the eggshells had disappeared and it cannot be separated.
1633	incorrect	The water splashed because the fork was vibrating. Vibrations make sounds.	Because when you hit the tuning fork makes waves.
1876	correct	A car is made of a lot of iron or steel.	The car could be made of iron.
1227	incorrect	Lee should put one of the loose wires on one part of the object and the other loose wire on another part of the object and see if the object completes the circuit.	By putting the wires together.
694	correct	Use a standard unit of mass like grams.	Use a standard like a gram.
679	incorrect	Use a standard unit of mass like grams.	Use little marbles.
4913	incorrect	She recommended the topographic map because the map shows the elevations along the trail. Pam would know where the trail was the steepest.	So you would see the steep sides like 5000.
2166	incorrect	The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.	The motors at the right will not run because the electricity flows out of the negative side and they have the D-cells trying to make electricity flow out the positive side.
3356	incorrect	There is 30 grams (20 grams plus 10 grams) in the right cup. The balance is tipped down on the ball side which means the ball weighs more than 30 grams. 40 grams is the only weight heavier than 30 grams.	Because 20 grams plus 10 grams equals 30 grams.
890	incorrect	When the string was shorter, the pitch was higher.	It will not make loud pluck like the other strings.
3373	correct	The embryo contains the tiny leaves and root of the plant.	A plant.
4789	correct	The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.	As the number of blocks increases the distance decreases.
4436	incorrect	Measure out equal masses of walnuts and peanuts. Smash the samples uniformly in the same size area on brown paper. Wait the same time for each sample.	Put the foods on 2 different papers and smash them and in 2 days look how big they are.
921	contradictory	When the string was shorter, the pitch was higher.	It will have a lower sound than when you let go.
546	correct	Use a standard unit of measurement such as centimeters or meters.	They could use a standard unit to measure the rug.
2902	correct	A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.	Making a bigger hole causes more water which makes it flow faster causing more erosion. Also having a steep slope makes water flow faster causing more erosion.
2574	correct	The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.	This happens because when a parallel circuit is formed like this one the D-cell still allows the electricity to flow through the circuit.
1676	incorrect	If the motor runs, the object is a conductor.	To try it out and see if it is a conductor.
119	incorrect	In the afternoon, shadows point east because the Sun is in the west. So the west side is opposite of the shadows.	Because the sun rises at the east and the sun is moving.
2645	incorrect	The mixtures are all clear.	The evidence is the water cannot take any more ingredients.
3070	incorrect	A standard is used for comparison to determine how changing one variable changes the results.	So when you change variables you can compare you standard and the other ones.
2198	incorrect	All variables except the girl need to be held constant (controlled). The girls all need to throw the same ball and use the same launch technique.	To make the balls the same thing so it is a fair game to play. Like a baseball, basketball or a football to throw.
1367	incorrect	You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.	You do not have to pull much rope with the single fixed but it is heavier.
2661	correct	You can see how much time is taken for the earth materials to move.	The information I got from the stream table but not from the stream tables are when earth materials slump and hole under the water source.
1678	correct	If the motor runs, the object is a conductor.	You will know if the motor turns on that it is a good conductor.
677	incorrect	Use a standard unit of mass like grams.	They should use the same marbles.
4280	incorrect	Crystals of different materials have different shapes. So the shape will help identify the material.	Take other crystals and compare to see which ones are kind of the same.
2427	incorrect	Susan should compare the amount of gas in each bag. The bag with the most gas contains the food with the most sugar.	The yeast will react and the bag is going to fill up with and measure it with air and measure it with a volume measure.
3682	incorrect	Fabric A is smoother and has a finer texture. Fabric B is rougher and has a coarser texture.	They do not have the same rubbing material to be the same.
742	incorrect	In the morning the Sun is in the east so shadows point west. In the afternoon the Sun is in the west so shadows point east.	The bus sign faces different directions because the earth move throughout the day the sun does not move.
1851	incorrect	The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.	Because when the water goes through the filter some water stays which helps the filter catch the sugar.
770	incorrect	X. When equal amounts of 2 solutions are compared, the solution that is more concentrated will have the greater mass (weigh more). 50 milliliters of X has a greater mass than 50 milliliters of Y, so X must be more concentrated.	X, well on a balance is on the bottom and if it can lift the other solution it is more concentrated.
1027	incorrect	The sand particles are larger and settle first. The flour particles are smaller and therefore settle more slowly.	Because the sand is heavy and flour is light.
3295	incorrect	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Sammy - Because they all are different sound with Sammy but Nathaniel make all the same sounds.
399	correct	If a part of the plant contains seeds, that part is the fruit.	I will look at the seed.
4057	incorrect	The crystals were square with Xs on the surface.	The crystals are kosher salt and kosher salt is salt!
1225	correct	Lee should put one of the loose wires on one part of the object and the other loose wire on another part of the object and see if the object completes the circuit.	Lee can put the object in the middle of the wires hanging down. Then you put the wires against the sides of the object.
1561	correct	If the string is shorter, the pitch will be higher. If the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	The short string has a higher pitch the long string has a lower pitch.
2290	correct	The fizzing indicates a gas, a new material, is produced. When a new material is produced, a chemical reaction has occurred.	It is a chemical reaction because it made a gas and a gas only appears if there is a chemical reaction.
4797	contradictory	The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.	It went farther with less blocks and it went no farther with more blocks.
2482	correct	That circuit is the only circuit that uses all of the correct contact points.	The electricity flows through the plus and the minus to a circle to the light bulb.
2207	correct	All variables except the girl need to be held constant (controlled). The girls all need to throw the same ball and use the same launch technique.	The girls have to have the same type of ball and also take the same amount of steps when they are throwing it.
641	correct	Solar water heaters with blue collectors heat up faster than solar water heaters with red collectors.	The blue absorbs most of the sun and red did not absorb most of the sun.
193	correct	A reaction was indicated by the bubbles of gas (a new material) being produced.	Because there were gas bubbles.
2852	incorrect	Put acid on a rock. If the acid fizzes, Phil would know that the rock has calcite.	Put the cold acid and wait for it react.
3757	incorrect	Bubbling means a gas has formed. Gas is a new material. A new material indicates a reaction.	Because when it bubbles that means a reaction is taking place.
2417	incorrect	Susan should compare the amount of gas in each bag. The bag with the most gas contains the food with the most sugar.	Whichever bag has the highest recording has the most sugar.
4810	correct	The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.	The more number of blocks the less distance it goes or the less block the more distance.
3958	incorrect	40 meters. The change in elevation is 20 meters between A and B and 20 meters between B and C. So the change between A and C is 40 meters. 20 m plus 20 m equals 40 m.	40 meters, It is on an accurate scale.
1889	incorrect	A car is made of a lot of iron or steel.	A box is on the side of the road and it sends a signal to the light.
4918	incorrect	She recommended the topographic map because the map shows the elevations along the trail. Pam would know where the trail was the steepest.	Pam's friend recommended the topographic map because it shows the elevation of the mountain they are hiking.
3614	correct	The rubber band vibrates.	Because the rubber band vibrated, and vibration caused sound.
2746	incorrect	The elytra are used to make sounds.	Abdomen.
2549	correct	Topaz would be the hardest of the 4 minerals because none of the tools could scratch topaz and at least one tool could scratch each of the other minerals.	Topaz would be hardest because none of the tools could scratch it and at least one tool could scratch X, Y, and Z.
1525	contradictory	The motor will run.	When the switch is moved nothing will work.
1396	incorrect	There is a complete circuit connecting the bulb to the D-cell battery.	It is like turning on a light switch.
2169	correct	The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.	Because a negative and a negative will not work.
3639	contradictory	The rubber band vibrates.	Because it hits your Finger.
727	incorrect	In the morning the Sun is in the east so shadows point west. In the afternoon the Sun is in the west so shadows point east.	Because the sun sets in the opposite direction. So what happens is the shadow will be on the opposite side.
2823	correct	A heat sink is any material that absorbs (a lot of) heat.	A heat sink is something that absorbs heat and gives it off slowly.
539	incorrect	Use a standard unit of measurement such as centimeters or meters.	The size of the rug was 18 grams.
3211	contradictory	Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.	No because Richard has more water than Mariella and Mariella only has 100 milliliters of water. And it is more crowded with 100 milliliters of water.
1909	contradictory	Earth materials settle out during deposition.	The earth material gets worn away.
1488	incorrect	Emily's crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals shown on the key.	Because the picture down below of Epsom salt has no lines or anything.
2815	incorrect	A heat sink is any material that absorbs (a lot of) heat.	It is a material that may lower heat.
2375	correct	The salt crystals are squares with Xs on top.	The salt crystals shape is a square.
1570	correct	If the string is shorter, the pitch will be higher. If the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	A long string has more room to vibrate so it makes a low sound and it is opposite for a short string.
3360	incorrect	There is 30 grams (20 grams plus 10 grams) in the right cup. The balance is tipped down on the ball side which means the ball weighs more than 30 grams. 40 grams is the only weight heavier than 30 grams.	20 grams plus 10 grams equals 30 grams.
1327	correct	The harder coin will scratch the other.	Maybe he should scratch even other then when you are done see if one have scratches.
1393	contradictory	There is a complete circuit connecting the bulb to the D-cell battery.	Because it is not complete.
3736	incorrect	The circuit does not include both contact points on the bulb holder, so the electricity can not go through the bulb.	Because it is not in a circle.
856	incorrect	When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.	I think red reflected the heat away.
2407	incorrect	Susan should compare the amount of gas in each bag. The bag with the most gas contains the food with the most sugar.	Whichever food has the most carbohydrates has more sugar. And that is how she will know her results.
248	correct	A. The water in Julie's heater got hotter faster (or had a greater temperature change in 20 minutes). The collector in heater A has the greater surface area so the water in A would get hotter faster than the water in B.	A. A because it has more black painted than in box B so A absorbs more than B.
2362	incorrect	If the key sticks, the key is iron; if the key does not stick the key is aluminum.	You can try it out altogether.
4962	correct	When the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	It would be lower pitch.
3688	incorrect	Fabric A is smoother and has a finer texture. Fabric B is rougher and has a coarser texture.	A tells you it has dashing lines B is telling us it has bumps.
2324	contradictory	No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.	Well she could try the light would not work as strong as the motor.
4577	correct	Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.	The solutions have the same amount of solute, there is just more on the bottom of the cup in cup 2.
870	incorrect	When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.	Because you do not have enough information to compare the data.
361	incorrect	The crystals have different shapes. Salt crystals are square with little Xs. The calcite crystals are shaped like needles (long and skinny).	Calcite look like this the salt, drew picture, crystals look like this, drew picture.
2219	incorrect	All variables except the girl need to be held constant (controlled). The girls all need to throw the same ball and use the same launch technique.	What the 3 girls need to do is stand straight and same sized ball.
2223	incorrect	All variables except the girl need to be held constant (controlled). The girls all need to throw the same ball and use the same launch technique.	They all needed to have the same ball.
3991	incorrect	The cotyledon provides food for the plant until the plant can make food for itself.	A cotyledon in the food supply.
4047	incorrect	The crystals were square with Xs on the surface.	They looked like salt.
4563	correct	The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.	The clay is deposited there because the clay is the lightest and everything else is heavier so it sinks.
3240	incorrect	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Sammy - Because Sammy's idea is better because Sammy is different kind of blocks and Nathaniel is just one kind of block but they are different size.
457	incorrect	Earth materials erode and are carried by flowing water (a river). The earth materials form a delta when the materials are dropped off or deposited when the water stops flowing (at the mouth of a river).	A delta is formed when flowing water pushes sand to opposite sides forming a delta.
3209	incorrect	Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.	Yes because if you take out a certain amount of water out of each of them and weigh them and they will weigh the same.
1683	correct	If the motor runs, the object is a conductor.	The motor will work and that annoying buzz will come back.
957	correct	Water heats up faster when covered.	The graph show that using a cover heats up the water on absorbs heat faster than without a cover because if it has a cover the breeze will not blow away the heat of the surface of the water.
2240	incorrect	Different girls are throwing the balls. The girls use different launch techniques. Each girl uses a different type of ball.	How far they throw the balls and the kind of balls that bring are 2 uncontrolled variables.
50	incorrect	Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.	What do you mean I do not how what you are say to me so can you help me.
2596	correct	The launch position (line on the playground) is the variable that is controlled.	Where they let go of the ball.
151	correct	No, Fruity cream cookies are not pure sugar. The cookies did not produce as much gas as was produced by the pure sugar.	Fruity Cream cookies are not pure sugar because if it was pure sugar, it would be just like the pure sugar in other tube.
3485	incorrect	Darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors. The dark green sheeting is the darkest color available so she should use the green sheeting.	Because the color black or dark colors will absorb the heat then transfer it to the water.
4863	incorrect	Both finger patterns are loops.	They are the same.
1364	incorrect	You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.	Single fixed only has one rope connected to the load.
2877	incorrect	A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.	Because if we use a source with a bigger hole it will drop faster and makes it slope steeper.
1636	incorrect	The water splashed because the fork was vibrating. Vibrations make sounds.	The sound waves travel through the water.
96	incorrect	Diva needs to know how much gas pure sugar produced in order to decide whether the cookies are pure sugar. Diva needs to make a controlled experiment.	To show her dad the cookies are not equal to pure sugar.
2602	incorrect	The launch position (line on the playground) is the variable that is controlled.	The variable the girls controlled was the way they threw the ball.
2404	incorrect	The salt crystals are squares with Xs on top.	They have X in them.
827	incorrect	A solution is a mixture formed when a solid dissolves in a liquid.	The difference from other mixtures was that we only used 2 and other people might use 3 or 4.

4422	correct	Fruitsnap contains little or no vitamin C so Fruitsnap does not change the color of the indophenol.	It did not change color to white or clear because it does not have vitamin C.
2731	correct	The elytra are used to make sounds.	To make sounds.
4388	incorrect	The shorter the string is, the more the string swings in 15 seconds.  The longer the string is, the less the string swings in 15 seconds.	If they made a swinger for like 20 inches it can swing less or high.
4788	incorrect	The crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals.	Because it has the same shape and size.
2594	incorrect	The launch position (line on the playground) is the variable that is controlled.	The girls controlled the basketball and baseball. Also a football.
1279	incorrect	20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.	I decided what the temperature was going to be because if you look at 10 minutes it will look like its going up by 3's.
3418	incorrect	An experiment is controlled if only one variable is changed at a time.	Where you control the variables, length, mass, release position. But you cannot control the amount of time it swings.
2489	correct	That circuit is the only circuit that uses all of the correct contact points.	The wires have to touch the light bulb so like a circle of air to light up the light bulb.
4655	correct	Overly Orange takes fewer drops to change the color of indophenol so Overly Orange has a higher concentration of vitamin C.	Overly Orange contains a higher concentration of vitamin C, because it took less drops to change the color.
3716	correct	The circuit does not include both contact points on the bulb holder, so the electricity can not go through the bulb.	It will not light because one wire has to go in one side and one wire has to go in the other.
3004	incorrect	The food contains sugar.	It indicates that the it has acid in it.
3479	incorrect	Darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors. The dark green sheeting is the darkest color available so she should use the green sheeting.	I pick B because I think it is ok alright.
1379	incorrect	You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.	Another disadvantage might be that you cannot lift the load as high as you can in the single fixed because you are using more string.
2161	incorrect	The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.	Because the wires in between the D-cells are connected to the same end.
3049	correct	A standard is used for comparison to determine how changing one variable changes the results.	You start with a standard so you can compare your standard data to your data when you change a variable.
571	incorrect	The motor will continue to run because the motor still has a pathway to the D-cell.	It would stay on.
2193	correct	All variables except the girl need to be held constant (controlled). The girls all need to throw the same ball and use the same launch technique.	They need to use the same ball and throw it from the same spot without running to the line, taking steps to the line, or one person just standing at the line.
1506	correct	The motor will run.	The electricity is moving through the circuit.
2646	correct	The mixtures are all clear.	Because there is nothing at the bottom.
2022	correct	If the effort is applied farther from the fulcrum, less effort will lift the load.	The farther away the effort is from the fulcrum the greater advantage you get.
1649	incorrect	The water splashed because the fork was vibrating. Vibrations make sounds.	She will what experiment.
3963	correct	40 meters. The change in elevation is 20 meters between A and B and 20 meters between B and C. So the change between A and C is 40 meters. 20 m plus 20 m equals 40 m.	40 meters, I know because the distance between contour lines do not change.

1904	incorrect	Earth materials settle out during deposition.	They go to a different place.
2843	incorrect	Put acid on a rock. If the acid fizzes, Phil would know that the rock has calcite.	He should put it in a vial with vinegar and then drop only the vinegar on later and when it is done there should be white crystals.
4703	correct	The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.	They are the same, because there is a pattern, for every 2 spoons of solute add 50 milliliters of water.
2033	correct	If the effort is applied farther from the fulcrum, less effort will lift the load.	As the effort gets farther from the fulcrum it is easier to lift the load.

3872	incorrect	The loops begin at opposite sides of the print.	They are facing different directions.
4534	contradictory	A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.	B. The graph helped me decide which container had dry soil because I know that water is a better heat sink and wet soil has water in it.
4101	incorrect	The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.	Because the salt dissolved in the water and the sand did not.
2910	correct	The mirror would complete the image of the object and make the object appear whole.	You would see the other side but it would be in the mirror.
1109	incorrect	Seeing multiple colors would show that vinegar can separate the permanent ink.	She will see the different pigments.

1100	correct	Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.	Yes. Yes because light colors will reflect the sun and black or darker colors will absorb the sun and if light or white colors reflect the sun then it will not get as much heat as the black or light colors.
3352	incorrect	There is 30 grams (20 grams plus 10 grams) in the right cup. The balance is tipped down on the ball side which means the ball weighs more than 30 grams. 40 grams is the only weight heavier than 30 grams.	Because if you see it is that because I chose it.
1824	incorrect	When less than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the greater the mass of beans harvested. When more than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the less the mass of beans harvested.	0 scoops it got 0.2, one scoop got 0.7, 2 scoops it got 1.2, 3 scoops got 1.5, 4 scoops it got 1.2.
1464	incorrect	Emily's crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals shown on the key.	I chose alum because it looks like alum and the mystery solution have the same pattern.
3358	incorrect	There is 30 grams (20 grams plus 10 grams) in the right cup. The balance is tipped down on the ball side which means the ball weighs more than 30 grams. 40 grams is the only weight heavier than 30 grams.	Because there is no standard unit.
1266	correct	20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.

2187	correct	The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.	The negative end is pointing at the negative end so no electricity can flow to the motors.
835	incorrect	A solution is a mixture formed when a solid dissolves in a liquid.	A solution is a different type of mixture. Then they are a solution is a mixtures that dissolves.
2930	incorrect	The mirror would complete the image of the object and make the object appear whole.	The reflection of the object.
4130	contradictory	Water will always flow downhill (mountain to valley).	Rivers usually flow through valley. It grow weaker at the mountain because it cannot go uphill.
3887	incorrect	The loops begin at opposite sides of the print.	They are facing different ways.
1827	incorrect	When less than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the greater the mass of beans harvested. When more than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the less the mass of beans harvested.	The higher the scoops the more but just 3 and down.

The collector in heater A has the greater surface area so the water in A would get hotter faster than the water in B.	A. I choose A because it heated up faster and was spread out so it heated up faster.
4844	incorrect	When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.	The magnetism goes through the paperclip.
1276	correct	20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.	I decided it would be 6 Celsius for 10 minutes because it is counting by 3's. Also because the bigger it gets the hotter it would be.
4592	incorrect	Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.	Because Tabby said that the solute and water were the same and I believe him and it says that they both have the same thing on the bottom clear, material on the bottom.

192	correct	A reaction was indicated by the bubbles of gas (a new material) being produced.	The bubbles made a reaction.
1389	contradictory	There is a complete circuit connecting the bulb to the D-cell battery.	Nothing will happen because you have to have a switch in front of the negative side to have it work.
2329	correct	No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.	No, because there is not going to be a closed circuit on both sides.
2890	correct	A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.	I choose water source with a bigger hole because the more water the more momentum to destroy. I chose a slope because the water will travel fast.
608	contradictory	When the string was tighter, the pitch was higher.	The string is lower when you tightened it.
4906	incorrect	She recommended the topographic map because the map shows the elevations along the trail. Pam would know where the trail was the steepest.	Because it need to walk a little be that is why I think she recommend to her.

2179	incorrect	The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.	Maybe the left wire went out of energy so maybe the right one went out of energy so both of them are out.
2582	incorrect	The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.	The bulb share the same D-Cell.
1859	correct	The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.	Because in the filter paper there are little holes!
3194	contradictory	Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.	No because they have the same solid but different amounts of water.
2816	contradictory	A heat sink is any material that absorbs (a lot of) heat.	When the temperature drops.

1136	incorrect	Seeing multiple colors would show that vinegar can separate the permanent ink.	Sarah will know if she watches it wick.
1337	correct	The harder coin will scratch the other.	How you would know that one of them is harder is for say if the nickel never a scratch the penny, and the penny got scratch by the nickel then the nickel would be harder than the penny that is how you would which one is harder.
1873	correct	A car is made of a lot of iron or steel.	The car has iron or steel on it so the magnet sends a signal.
380	incorrect	The crystals have different shapes. Salt crystals are square with little Xs. The calcite crystals are shaped like needles (long and skinny).	The calcite can be white and crystals is black.
902	incorrect	When the string was shorter, the pitch was higher.	When it vibrates it goes so fast but it hits the string.
3919	contradictory	Agree. Vibrations are movements. Vibrations produce sound.	Yes, because sound has to vibrate it.
4602	incorrect	Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.	I put A because it is the same because it the same amount of water and only 2 scoops more than the other one.
4591	incorrect	Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.	Because both cup one and 2 are already concentrated. Neither cup one or 2 can hold any more solvent.

3059	incorrect	A standard is used for comparison to determine how changing one variable changes the results.	You use a standard because without a standard, you can change it.
4737	correct	When the string is tighter, the pitch will be higher.	It would be a high pitch.
4599	contradictory	Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.	Because solution 2 is more concentrate because it has more spoonfuls.
3408	correct	An experiment is controlled if only one variable is changed at a time.	A controlled experiment is when you only change one variable at a time.
2597	incorrect	The launch position (line on the playground) is the variable that is controlled.	How far the balls went in the field.

4036	incorrect	As time increases, the speed of light stays the same (remains constant).	This stays the same.
4463	incorrect	Measure out equal masses of walnuts and peanuts. Smash the samples uniformly in the same size area on brown paper. Wait the same time for each sample.	The procedure Anna can use is she can get a grit chart to count the squares to see how much fat it has. Then see if they both compare to each other.
1239	correct	Lee should put one of the loose wires on one part of the object and the other loose wire on another part of the object and see if the object completes the circuit.	The 2 wires from the switch board and the D-cell. You take the wires and put them up to something and if the motor run it conducts electricity.

4082	incorrect	The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.	The salt went through the filter because it dissolved and the sand did not.
3759	incorrect	Bubbling means a gas has formed. Gas is a new material. A new material indicates a reaction.	Because it bubbled.
1700	incorrect	Jim would see a clear solution. 3 spoons of solid dissolves, so 2 spoons will dissolve.	I think that the mixture would be clear with nothing on the bottom, because both mixture one and 3 say that if mixture 3 is not saturated and has more material than 2, 2 would not be saturated either.
3400	incorrect	An experiment is controlled if only one variable is changed at a time.	The longer the string the shorter the swings.
918	correct	When the string was shorter, the pitch was higher.	And the shorter the string also the higher pitch it makes.
4732	correct	When the string is tighter, the pitch will be higher.	It would be a higher pitch.
4512	contradictory	A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.	A. I knew dry soil was B because it lets in heat fast and lets it go fast, so dry soil is not a good heat sink.
2203	incorrect	All variables except the girl need to be held constant (controlled). The girls all need to throw the same ball and use the same launch technique.	They need to use the same kind of balls and they need the same procedure of throwing.
2145	incorrect	A chemical reaction occurred. [The white solid is a precipitate (a new material) which indicates the reaction.]	The white solid indicates that a precipitate has occurred.
2554	incorrect	The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.	Because there is only one D-Cell so 3 bulbs will definitely not work worse.
338	correct	Greta and Andre have different sized hands.	They have bigger or smaller sized hands.
2172	incorrect	The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.	They will not run because the electricity gets stopped when it goes through the D-cells.
1797	incorrect	When less than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the greater the mass of beans harvested. When more than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the less the mass of beans harvested.	As the scoops increase the mass increases until it gets too much fertilizer.
1191	correct	Bill must have been using degrees Celsius if 28 is a warm temperature.	He is using degrees Celsius.

They both have the same amount of surface area in the container and are filled with the same amount of water.
418	incorrect	If a part of the plant contains seeds, that part is the fruit.	The flowers.
4557	incorrect	The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.	It is deposited because the water, river is taking it away with it.
1964	correct	If the middle bulb burns out the other 2 bulbs will stay lit.	The other bulbs will still light.
3717	correct	The circuit does not include both contact points on the bulb holder, so the electricity can not go through the bulb.	There is not 2 wires for each little clip. There needs to be one coming from one clip and another coming from the other clip.
2079	correct	The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.	They both have material on the bottom.
1746	correct	The bulb will light.	The light and motor goes on.

4161	incorrect	The water was evaporated, leaving the salt.	We poured the salt into a Petri dish and poured the water out.
1413	incorrect	There is a complete circuit connecting the bulb to the D-cell battery.	If she move the battery back it will light up.
4482	incorrect	The root grows first so the root can take up water for the plant.	Because that is a part of the plant.
4407	correct	Fruitsnap contains little or no vitamin C so Fruitsnap does not change the color of the indophenol.	It did not change because the Fruitsnap did not have any vitamin C.
3298	incorrect	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Sammy - Sammy's is easier because Sammy's idea has metal, plastic, and wood so it would be easier to discriminate the properties of the objects.
3678	correct	As time increases, the number of tree rings also increases.	The time is increasing the tree rings are increasing.
1245	incorrect	Lee should put one of the loose wires on one part of the object and the other loose wire on another part of the object and see if the object completes the circuit.	She can put the wire to the other half of the D-cell and the switch and make it work.
3346	incorrect	There is 30 grams (20 grams plus 10 grams) in the right cup. The balance is tipped down on the ball side which means the ball weighs more than 30 grams. 40 grams is the only weight heavier than 30 grams.	Because the mass pieces gives you the answer.
1371	incorrect	You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.	Another disadvantage would be you have to pull more rope to get it where you want it to go.
3988	correct	The cotyledon provides food for the plant until the plant can make food for itself.	The cotyledon gives food to the plant until it grows roots.
3385	incorrect	The embryo contains the tiny leaves and root of the plant.	Helps root, leaves, and stem.

3808	correct	Shadows change during the day because the Earth is turning. The Sun stays in one place.	By turning the globe.
878	correct	When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.	Because then you would not know if the red covered or the blue uncovered heated up as much as the others. Because even though they are the same color the water is in a different environment. So, it would not provide useful information.
3662	incorrect	As time increases, the number of tree rings also increases.	This graph tells me the number of tree rings on the y axis and tells me the time on the x axis.
3817	correct	Shadows change during the day because the Earth is turning. The Sun stays in one place.	It would best demonstrate shadows change because the flashlight is acting as the sun, and the globe as the earth, so the earth would rotate, not the sun.
1978	correct	You can not tell because we do not know the strength of the magnets. If the magnets are weak, the second piece of foam might put too much distance between the 2 magnets for the interaction to hold the magnets in place. If the magnets are strong the magnets might stay in place.	Because the force field might be big enough to go through both foam blocks but it might not be.

1058	incorrect	The marbles used by the 2 groups were probably different masses.	The marbles are different.
226	correct	A. The water in Julie's heater got hotter faster (or had a greater temperature change in 20 minutes). The collector in heater A has the greater surface area so the water in A would get hotter faster than the water in B.	A. A because black is shown more on the bottom and so the black absorbed the heat.
332	correct	Greta and Andre have different sized hands.	Because the hands are not the same size.
4522	incorrect	A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.	A. Because dry soil heats more in the sun.
1519	incorrect	The motor will run.	The light will turn off.

121	contradictory	In the afternoon, shadows point east because the Sun is in the west. So the west side is opposite of the shadows.	Because the sun is pointing east and the shadow have to point to the north.
2897	incorrect	A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.	My choice increases water speed and the faster something is going the more it can hold.
2673	incorrect	You can see how much time is taken for the earth materials to move.	You get the time in which things happened.
4952	correct	When the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	It would change to a low pitch.
4882	contradictory	Both finger patterns are loops.	They are both arches.
19	incorrect	Elena should include a separate shelter for each lizard.	Some leaves and some wood.
2564	incorrect	The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.	That happens because just because one burns out does not mean the rest will and electricity can still flow.
2553	contradictory	The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.	Because I think it is a series and series have to share and takes more power to form it.
4586	contradictory	Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.	Because there is the same amount of solvent but there is more solute in cup 2.
1096	correct	Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.	Yes. Since the box is black, black attracts or absorbs heat faster, the other box is white which reflects more sunlight than absorbing it.
55	contradictory	Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.	No because silver chloride is different than silver nitrate.
4361	correct	The shorter the string is, the more the string swings in 15 seconds.  The longer the string is, the less the string swings in 15 seconds.	The longer the string the less swings or, the shorter the string the more swings.
872	incorrect	When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.	Because the red uncovered has a low temperature and blue covered has a high temperature.
4214	correct	Anna should compare the size of the grease spots. The sample with the larger grease spot has more fat.	Using only the results from her experiment, Anna will know which one has more fat in it by the larger the grease spot the more fat.
1002	incorrect	The sand particles are larger and settle first. The flour particles are smaller and therefore settle more slowly.	Evaporating separates the 2.

1932	incorrect	Earth materials settle out during deposition.	They are carried and stack upon each other and settle to the bottom.
4941	incorrect	When the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	Louder.
1916	incorrect	Earth materials settle out during deposition.	The earth materials are carried away and dropped off at the end.
518	incorrect	The saxophone has the longest and fattest tube.	Because the instrument is thicker than the others.
382	incorrect	The crystals have different shapes. Salt crystals are square with little Xs. The calcite crystals are shaped like needles (long and skinny).	The crystals did not look much like calcite but the did not look like salt either.
1689	incorrect	Jim would see a clear solution. 3 spoons of solid dissolves, so 2 spoons will dissolve.	It has been a little different.
1911	incorrect	Earth materials settle out during deposition.	What happens to it is that the deposition goes more far away from the stream table.
2755	incorrect	The elytra are used to make sounds.	Another function is the horn.
2405	incorrect	The salt crystals are squares with Xs on top.	The salt has the letter X.

4312	correct	Wendy should hook one end of the wire to the negative side of a D-cell battery and the other end to the positive side of the D-cell battery.	Then Wendy should get another piece of wire and wrap it around the nail also then connect the other end of the wire to a negative and a positive.
231	correct	A. The water in Julie's heater got hotter faster (or had a greater temperature change in 20 minutes). The collector in heater A has the greater surface area so the water in A would get hotter faster than the water in B.	A. A is set flat down on the ground spreading the water around and it has a larger black space which will absorb more heat heating the water faster.
4640	correct	C. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. Pan C has the most dark surface area so C would heat up the fastest and have the highest temperature.	C. They all absorbed the heat. When these disks they absorb and pass the heat between all of them and that is why.
2152	incorrect	A chemical reaction occurred. [The white solid is a precipitate (a new material) which indicates the reaction.]	We kept on glassing because it become clear.
1029	correct	The sand particles are larger and settle first. The flour particles are smaller and therefore settle more slowly.	The sand is heavier than flour the sand goes down because it is heavy the flour is light.
3951	contradictory	40 meters. The change in elevation is 20 meters between A and B and 20 meters between B and C. So the change between A and C is 40 meters. 20 m plus 20 m equals 40 m.	60 meters, I labeled them. I also knew C is the third letter in the alphabet so I counted by 20 3 times.
4859	incorrect	When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.	The first paperclips gets strong and give it to these conduct and they are one.
2297	incorrect	The fizzing indicates a gas, a new material, is produced. When a new material is produced, a chemical reaction has occurred.	Because when more than 2 chemicals are mixed it produces fizzing.
2678	incorrect	You can see how much time is taken for the earth materials to move.	They explain it in words instead of using pictures.
3237	incorrect	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Sammy - Because the plastic, metal wood might sound different!
2340	correct	If the key sticks, the key is iron; if the key does not stick the key is aluminum.	It will stick to iron.
3891	incorrect	The loops begin at opposite sides of the print.	They are flipped around.
2701	incorrect	So that people notice the sound.	Because the fire alarm would when a house is on fire.
4069	incorrect	The crystals were square with Xs on the surface.	Because crystals are a kind of salt.
3480	incorrect	Darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors. The dark green sheeting is the darkest color available so she should use the green sheeting.	Because the dark green will absorb the heat.
3412	correct	An experiment is controlled if only one variable is changed at a time.	You define a controlled experiment when you only change one variable at a time.
1963	contradictory	If the middle bulb burns out the other 2 bulbs will stay lit.	The third will not burn out.
209	correct	A reaction was indicated by the bubbles of gas (a new material) being produced.	Because it bubbled.
1068	incorrect	Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.	Yes. The black box will get hotter than the white because the black box can hold more heat.
180	correct	A reaction was indicated by the bubbles of gas (a new material) being produced.	She did make a reaction by saying that there was bubbles in the cup.
4659	contradictory	Overly Orange takes fewer drops to change the color of indophenol so Overly Orange has a higher concentration of vitamin C.	Luscious Lemon has a higher concentration of vitamin C because lemons are really sour and Overly Orange was not that sour.
2113	incorrect	There is a complete circuit connecting the motor to the D-cell battery.	I learned it in class.
2540	contradictory	Topaz would be the hardest of the 4 minerals because none of the tools could scratch topaz and at least one tool could scratch each of the other minerals.	I know it is Z because it has one yes and 2 no's.
3707	incorrect	Fabric A is smoother and has a finer texture. Fabric B is rougher and has a coarser texture.	If there bumpy or smooth or rough and show what the texture is.
3944	contradictory	40 meters. The change in elevation is 20 meters between A and B and 20 meters between B and C. So the change between A and C is 40 meters. 20 m plus 20 m equals 40 m.	30, well because if A and B equals 20 meters and B true C looked like 10 more meters and I think is 30 meters.
3484	correct	Darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors. The dark green sheeting is the darkest color available so she should use the green sheeting.	I chose dark green because dark colors attract the sun.
1242	incorrect	Lee should put one of the loose wires on one part of the object and the other loose wire on another part of the object and see if the object completes the circuit.	Lee can test some things on this objects and see if it works.
4901	incorrect	She recommended the topographic map because the map shows the elevations along the trail. Pam would know where the trail was the steepest.	Because it is easier to read! And there is more information on it.
3840	correct	So people know exactly what the measurement means. A standard is necessary so everyone measures using the same unit and everyone gets the same measurement.	Because if you do not use a standard you get the answer wrong.
4733	correct	When the string is tighter, the pitch will be higher.	It would be high pitch.
1463	correct	Emily's crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals shown on the key.	Because on the key alum is a hexagon and a hexagon in the middle with lines going from each point to the point on the hexagon inside.
1043	incorrect	The marbles used by the 2 groups were probably different masses.	The marbles are different sizes.
3458	incorrect	The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.	It would be the same because for it to be greater than or less than it depends where you put the solar water heater.
4526	contradictory	A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.	B. Well, I know that water will heat up faster and I thought that maybe the soil will not heat up faster.
2067	contradictory	The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.	No because 5 has more scoops than 4.
1122	incorrect	Seeing multiple colors would show that vinegar can separate the permanent ink.	You will see the ink spread on the paper.
2842	correct	Put acid on a rock. If the acid fizzes, Phil would know that the rock has calcite.	Phil should put the rock in the vial. Then put vinegar in then look for a lot of bubble then put in cold acid in to wait for a few days.
2066	correct	The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.	The same because both solutions are saturated.
3153	correct	During a flood there is more water in the creek and the water flows faster.	The flood water rises and goes really fast picking up sand and dirt.
3115	correct	Compare prints to see if the patterns are the same.	They will look exactly the same, same size same pattern.
4871	correct	Both finger patterns are loops.	Loop.
786	incorrect	No, string is an insulator, so the pathway would not be completed.	No because the electricity will not go through the string because it has to be some steel or iron.
4192	correct	Many tiny bubbles will rise from the calcite when the calcite contacts the cold acid.	The rock would be covered by bubbles and fizz.
3016	correct	The cotyledon provides food for the plant to begin growing.	It feeds the baby plant.
390	incorrect	The crystals have different shapes. Salt crystals are square with little Xs. The calcite crystals are shaped like needles (long and skinny).	If you have a bowl and inside there is a crystal and you put vinegar in the bowl if it has calcite it will look like needles with salt it will look like yes.
804	correct	No, string is an insulator, so the pathway would not be completed.	No, because a piece of string does not have electricity in it.
1128	contradictory	Seeing multiple colors would show that vinegar can separate the permanent ink.	Because it will not do nothing and it will not wick.
4706	incorrect	The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.	It is like x like 50 times 2 equals 100 so then 2 spoons of solute equals 50.
67	contradictory	Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.	It could be possible chance it is correct but there could also be a 50 chance it is right and a 50 50 chance it is wrong. If they do not know they could do some test and research.
4892	correct	Both finger patterns are loops.	They both have a loop in them.
4187	incorrect	Many tiny bubbles will rise from the calcite when the calcite contacts the cold acid.	You would look for bubbling.
3396	correct	The embryo contains the tiny leaves and root of the plant.	The young plant.
567	incorrect	The motor will continue to run because the motor still has a pathway to the D-cell.	The motor will still run.
1514	correct	The motor will run.	The motor will run.
2834	correct	Put acid on a rock. If the acid fizzes, Phil would know that the rock has calcite.	Put part of the broken rock in the cup. Then add vinegar. If it starts bubbling a lot, it has calcite.
4642	correct	C. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. Pan C has the most dark surface area so C would heat up the fastest and have the highest temperature.	C. Box C has the most surface area covered so all the plastic circles would absorb energy so it would be the warmest.
1044	correct	The marbles used by the 2 groups were probably different masses.	One use small and big and marbles one use 60 and the other 60.
4102	incorrect	The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.	Because the salt is evaporated already and the sand cannot because it is hard and it is gravel.
2783	incorrect	Like poles repel and opposite poles attract.	The magnets are not touching because they are flipped around a certain way that they do not stick instead they repel.
4545	contradictory	The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.	Because clay is a bigger.
1442	correct	Rub the minerals together and see which one scratches the other.	She can scratch it together and look and see which leave a scratch.
618	incorrect	When the string was tighter, the pitch was higher.	Well when it is tightened you can not pull it that far so it makes a different sound.
773	incorrect	X. When equal amounts of 2 solutions are compared, the solution that is more concentrated will have the greater mass (weigh more). 50 milliliters of X has a greater mass than 50 milliliters of Y, so X must be more concentrated.	X, I think it is because it heavier. Remember I said I think.
3398	correct	An experiment is controlled if only one variable is changed at a time.	An experiment where you only change one variable.
3035	incorrect	The cotyledon provides food for the plant to begin growing.	It stores the food.
614	contradictory	When the string was tighter, the pitch was higher.	It would either make the pitch higher or lower.
3010	correct	The food contains sugar.	That the food she tested had a lot of sugar and because she probably put sugar in it.
2616	incorrect	The launch position (line on the playground) is the variable that is controlled.	How high it will go.
3440	correct	The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.	I think it will just be the same temperature. Because it is the same shape.
3846	incorrect	So people know exactly what the measurement means. A standard is necessary so everyone measures using the same unit and everyone gets the same measurement.	Because it is better using it so you will not get it wrong.
1777	correct	The harder mineral will leave a scratch on the less hard mineral. If the black mineral is harder, the brown mineral will have a scratch.	Scratch them together.
537	correct	Use a standard unit of measurement such as centimeters or meters.	They could use a meter tape.
4828	correct	When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.	He was able to do that because the magnetism traveled through the paperclips.
3456	correct	The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.	I think same because they both have the same amount of black and the surface area look the same, and they are both the same shape.
3499	incorrect	Darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors. The dark green sheeting is the darkest color available so she should use the green sheeting.	Because dark color absorbs more sunlight.
2836	incorrect	Put acid on a rock. If the acid fizzes, Phil would know that the rock has calcite.	Put the water in the vial and put the calcite in, if the water starts getting murky and bubbles float to the top there is calcite.
1630	incorrect	The water splashed because the fork was vibrating. Vibrations make sounds.	Because When you put the tuning fork in the water you can see the vibrations.
1365	incorrect	You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.	It would make it harder because if you divide 360 by how many supporting ropes a single fixed pulley has which is one then it would be 360 newtons for the effort that is 180 newtons harder to lift the load.
3909	contradictory	Agree. Vibrations are movements. Vibrations produce sound.	No because if you jump on a sofa the string will move and make noise.
4485	incorrect	The root grows first so the root can take up water for the plant.	Root hair.
2098	correct	There is a complete circuit connecting the motor to the D-cell battery.	That happen because the electricity is flowing around in a circle.
339	correct	Greta and Andre have different sized hands.	It was because they have different hand sizes.
1631	incorrect	The water splashed because the fork was vibrating. Vibrations make sounds.	Because you hit it on a wood and that make it vibrate.
1477	incorrect	Emily's crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals shown on the key.	Just a wild guess.
1059	incorrect	The marbles used by the 2 groups were probably different masses.	They weighed it wrong.
610	incorrect	When the string was tighter, the pitch was higher.	It was louder Because she made more tension.
807	incorrect	No, string is an insulator, so the pathway would not be completed.	No, because it does not have a wire and it cannot get energy.
967	correct	The brass ring would not stick to the nail because the ring is not iron. The nail is a temporary magnet, but brass cannot become a temporary magnet and thus does not stick to magnets.	It would not stick because a brass ring is not iron or steel.
3305	incorrect	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Sammy - Because they all sound different and blocks sound the same.
2467	correct	The circuit is not complete. The electrical pathway is broken.	I chose no because it is not a complete circuit.
4085	incorrect	The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.	The salt turns to liquid like an ice cube and then to water sand does not.
3268	contradictory	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Nathaniel - Because Nathaniel wants to put blocks of different sizes and it will make a different sound by the length.
1717	correct	Jim would see a clear solution. 3 spoons of solid dissolves, so 2 spoons will dissolve.	He would observe the solution clear and nothing at the bottom because one and 3 do not have anything at the bottom and if 3 does not have any solute at the bottom 2 would not either.
2191	correct	All variables except the girl need to be held constant (controlled). The girls all need to throw the same ball and use the same launch technique.	They need to have the same ball and throw the ball at the same place.
3781	incorrect	Bubbling means a gas has formed. Gas is a new material. A new material indicates a reaction.	Because he saw it fizz and bubble up.
4756	correct	The crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals.	Because on the key alum is a hexagon with a box in it and lines on the net observation it is the same.
4676	correct	Overly Orange takes fewer drops to change the color of indophenol so Overly Orange has a higher concentration of vitamin C.	Overly Orange has higher concentration and the evidence is the overly Orange has 8 drops and Luscious Lemon has 13 drops.
2132	incorrect	A chemical reaction occurred. [The white solid is a precipitate (a new material) which indicates the reaction.]	Well when you mix the 2 solutions it became a different mixture.
1077	incorrect	Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.	Black box. Because the black box absorb sunlight and that is why the black box is much more hotter than the white one.
4158	incorrect	The water was evaporated, leaving the salt.	You put the water, a little bit, in a cup and leave it overnight.
603	incorrect	When the string was tighter, the pitch was higher.	If you get it right it will not have much Frequency.
219	correct	A. The water in Julie's heater got hotter faster (or had a greater temperature change in 20 minutes). The collector in heater A has the greater surface area so the water in A would get hotter faster than the water in B.	A. It has higher results and her box is long and of course skinny.
3680	incorrect	As time increases, the number of tree rings also increases.	The rings and the tree rings are increasing.
696	incorrect	Use a standard unit of mass like grams.	To use a ruler to see if the 2 apples are different.
3838	incorrect	So people know exactly what the measurement means. A standard is necessary so everyone measures using the same unit and everyone gets the same measurement.	So you can get the measurement the same thing as everyone else.
2373	incorrect	The salt crystals are squares with Xs on top.	Looks like salt that has fizz on in it.
2638	incorrect	The mixtures are all clear.	That there is undissolved particle at the bottom.
4735	correct	When the string is tighter, the pitch will be higher.	It would change to a high pitch.
126	incorrect	In the afternoon, shadows point east because the Sun is in the west. So the west side is opposite of the shadows.	The sun rises on the east.
1847	correct	The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.	It stays at the top because it is too big to go through the filter and the water is just a liquid.
2205	incorrect	All variables except the girl need to be held constant (controlled). The girls all need to throw the same ball and use the same launch technique.	To make the contest a controlled experiment the girls need to take the same amount of steps.
654	correct	Solar water heaters with blue collectors heat up faster than solar water heaters with red collectors.	The blue gathers more heat than the red.
990	incorrect	The brass ring would not stick to the nail because the ring is not iron. The nail is a temporary magnet, but brass cannot become a temporary magnet and thus does not stick to magnets.	It will fall down. I find it.
1920	correct	Earth materials settle out during deposition.	Earth materials are washed away and settled to the bottom.
3985	incorrect	The cotyledon provides food for the plant until the plant can make food for itself.	The cotyledon is the inside.

4506	incorrect	A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.	A. Because of 20 number it helps by the line.
1345	correct	The harder coin will scratch the other.	If it left a scratch.
3122	correct	Compare prints to see if the patterns are the same.	By looking at the patterns.
4400	correct	Fruitsnap contains little or no vitamin C so Fruitsnap does not change the color of the indophenol.	It was probably concentrated or it could have little or no vitamin C.
3728	incorrect	The circuit does not include both contact points on the bulb holder, so the electricity can not go through the bulb.	The wires are not even.
4682	contradictory	The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.	B has more solute than A does therefore B will weigh more since the solute is equally spread.
4555	incorrect	The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.	It was deposited because it begins to settle to the bottom because the channel is slowing its current.
4242	incorrect	Anna should compare the size of the grease spots. The sample with the larger grease spot has more fat.	Look at the grease marks.
3033	incorrect	The cotyledon provides food for the plant to begin growing.	Food storage.
1500	correct	The motor will run.	The motor will run.
73	correct	Diva needs to know how much gas pure sugar produced in order to decide whether the cookies are pure sugar. Diva needs to make a controlled experiment.	Diva needed to test pure sugar so he know if the cookies was pure sugar.
4445	incorrect	Measure out equal masses of walnuts and peanuts. Smash the samples uniformly in the same size area on brown paper. Wait the same time for each sample.	Anna can put both samples on 2 different pieces of paper and see which one makes a bigger grease spot.
3022	incorrect	The cotyledon provides food for the plant to begin growing.	It stores the food.
26	incorrect	Elena should include a separate shelter for each lizard.	She should get a bigger and food and water.

1515	correct	The motor will run.	The motor will turn on.
1818	incorrect	When less than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the greater the mass of beans harvested. When more than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the less the mass of beans harvested.	If she puts too much scoops it goes down if she puts about 3 she gets more.
4932	incorrect	She recommended the topographic map because the map shows the elevations along the trail. Pam would know where the trail was the steepest.	To see the different landforms in front of them.
4467	incorrect	Measure out equal masses of walnuts and peanuts. Smash the samples uniformly in the same size area on brown paper. Wait the same time for each sample.	You could check on the back of the bag that sees which one have more grease.
2015	correct	If the effort is applied farther from the fulcrum, less effort will lift the load.	The further the effort, the less effort is needed. The closer the effort, the more is needed.
3058	correct	A standard is used for comparison to determine how changing one variable changes the results.	You use a standard because when you change something which is a variable. That when you change it, you know when you did before.
1116	incorrect	Seeing multiple colors would show that vinegar can separate the permanent ink.	Just wait for 3 minutes.
4157	incorrect	The water was evaporated, leaving the salt.	You just get water and the smashed mock rock and put the smashed rock and water together.
2544	incorrect	Topaz would be the hardest of the 4 minerals because none of the tools could scratch topaz and at least one tool could scratch each of the other minerals.	I know because a fingernail cannot be scratched the most.
4367	incorrect	The shorter the string is, the more the string swings in 15 seconds.  The longer the string is, the less the string swings in 15 seconds.	If the swinger is longer, than it has a longer distance to swing.
1164	contradictory	Yes, aluminum foil is a metal and all metals conduct. The aluminum foil would complete the circuit.	You can try, but I think it would not work.
4475	correct	The root grows first so the root can take up water for the plant.	So it can suck up water to grow.
613	correct	When the string was tighter, the pitch was higher.	It was higher.
2276	incorrect	The fizzing indicates a gas, a new material, is produced. When a new material is produced, a chemical reaction has occurred.	Because you made a gas.
4298	incorrect	Wendy should hook one end of the wire to the negative side of a D-cell battery and the other end to the positive side of the D-cell battery.	Attach the wire to each end of the nail.
3918	correct	Agree. Vibrations are movements. Vibrations produce sound.	Yes. When you move something it causes vibrations. And the vibrations cause sound waves.
233	correct	A. The water in Julie's heater got hotter faster (or had a greater temperature change in 20 minutes). The collector in heater A has the greater surface area so the water in A would get hotter faster than the water in B.	A. Since more of hers were on the ground on something dark it would absorb more heat because dark colors absorb more heat.
1244	correct	Lee should put one of the loose wires on one part of the object and the other loose wire on another part of the object and see if the object completes the circuit.	You can put it between the 2 wires if it makes the motor work but if it does not then it is an insulator.
4565	contradictory	The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.	Very near to the mouth of the river.
4038	incorrect	The crystals were square with Xs on the surface.	We used magnifying glasses and some sort of guide thing that told us what different kinds of salt looks like.
4333	incorrect	2: Trace the features from the photograph onto the overlay grid. 4: Transfer the features to the matching squares on the smaller grid in your notebook.	2. Put a compass rose on the map. 4. Trace the grid on the notebook.
3696	incorrect	Fabric A is smoother and has a finer texture. Fabric B is rougher and has a coarser texture.	On A they colored it light and on B they colored it hard.
2241	correct	Different girls are throwing the balls. The girls use different launch techniques. Each girl uses a different type of ball.	The variable that was not controlled was that they just brought any ball and made a line and threw it.
3228	incorrect	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Because what if there is only one metal item and you drop it and you hear metal.
1740	correct	The bulb will light.	If she moves the switch to the left everything will turn on.
505	correct	The saxophone has the longest and fattest tube.	Because it is the biggest one.
1721	contradictory	The bulb will light.	The light bulb will not work.

4675	correct	Overly Orange takes fewer drops to change the color of indophenol so Overly Orange has a higher concentration of vitamin C.	Overly Orange has the higher concentration of vitamin C because I took less amount of drops.
2937	correct	The mirror would complete the image of the object and make the object appear whole.	I would show the same thing so it would look like one whole piece.
536	correct	Use a standard unit of measurement such as centimeters or meters.	Next time they can use a measuring tape to be more accurate.
1996	incorrect	You can not tell because we do not know the strength of the magnets. If the magnets are weak, the second piece of foam might put too much distance between the 2 magnets for the interaction to hold the magnets in place. If the magnets are strong the magnets might stay in place.	It is too thick.
4542	correct	The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.	It will end up there because clay can be broken up into such tiny parts or sediments that it is easily carried by the water and will end up probably the farthest out in the lake.
1640	incorrect	The water splashed because the fork was vibrating. Vibrations make sounds.	Because if you put it in the water it has volume and volume helps make sound.
4895	incorrect	Both finger patterns are loops.	They are the same kind of finger patterns.
1265	incorrect	20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.	Because it went by 3 and that is why I pick that number.
1602	correct	The tree blocks the light from the Sun.	Because the sun is going on it and it is blocking the light.
2787	incorrect	Like poles repel and opposite poles attract.	Because the magnets have a north and south pole and if the north touches the north or visa-versa north the will not touch.
3465	correct	The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.	I chose same because they are the same figure and size. Y is facing the other way though it is still the same.
493	correct	A solution was created when the eggshells disappeared (dissolved) and the mixture ended up as a clear liquid.	Because she said the water was clear. When water is clear then it is a solution.
3171	incorrect	During a flood there is more water in the creek and the water flows faster.	The water in the creek during a flood is more capped than a normal molten. During a flood the water runs through more quickly and picks up earth materials in deposition first and takes them further. Also erosion happen more quickly.
2898	incorrect	A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.	Because the more water going at a faster pace because of the slopes will cause more erosion because gravity will help slope.
3491	incorrect	Darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors. The dark green sheeting is the darkest color available so she should use the green sheeting.	Because dark colors absorb the heat, and light colors do not. They reflect them.
667	correct	Solar water heaters with blue collectors heat up faster than solar water heaters with red collectors.	It tells me that the blue collectors heat up faster than the blue collectors.
113	incorrect	In the afternoon, shadows point east because the Sun is in the west. So the west side is opposite of the shadows.	Because I used a compass.
3916	correct	Agree. Vibrations are movements. Vibrations produce sound.	I agree with her because when you talk, your vocal cords moves and when you hear a sound, the things that made that sound must move and vibrate.
540	correct	Use a standard unit of measurement such as centimeters or meters.	They could use a meter tape.
4395	correct	The shorter the string is, the more the string swings in 15 seconds.  The longer the string is, the less the string swings in 15 seconds.	The longer the string the less swings The shorter the string the more swings.
4484	incorrect	The root grows first so the root can take up water for the plant.	Because the root searches for the nutrients so the embryo germinates into a stem and leaves.
687	incorrect	Use a standard unit of mass like grams.	If Jin's and Bee's groups can use a balance beam.
372	incorrect	The crystals have different shapes. Salt crystals are square with little Xs. The calcite crystals are shaped like needles (long and skinny).	One of them was whiter than the other and had more crystals.
1436	correct	Rub the minerals together and see which one scratches the other.	Scratch them together.
3711	incorrect	Fabric A is smoother and has a finer texture. Fabric B is rougher and has a coarser texture.	The rubbings tell you that you cannot see A. And later a string to tell you that it is darker than A.
3034	incorrect	The cotyledon provides food for the plant to begin growing.	A cotyledon is the part over the water.
2319	contradictory	No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.	Yes because all she has to do is put the motor and the light bulb on the same wire and put the switch in the middle.
3649	correct	As time increases, the number of tree rings also increases.	It tells me the number of rings grows. So does the time.
595	contradictory	The motor will continue to run because the motor still has a pathway to the D-cell.	It would not work.
4827	incorrect	When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.	Because it lets magnetism through the paperclips.
4715	contradictory	The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.	Solution B has more water so it weighs more than solution A.
4532	incorrect	A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.	A. Water makes things cooler so the dry soil gets hotter.
563	incorrect	Use a standard unit of measurement such as centimeters or meters.	Cut it.
4098	incorrect	The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.	It stayed there because of its size.
4960	correct	When the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	It will be low the pitch change.
3735	incorrect	The circuit does not include both contact points on the bulb holder, so the electricity can not go through the bulb.	The bulb will not light up because they are all not connected and this does not make a circuit.
3853	incorrect	So people know exactly what the measurement means. A standard is necessary so everyone measures using the same unit and everyone gets the same measurement.	Well you cannot use straws.
2024	correct	If the effort is applied farther from the fulcrum, less effort will lift the load.	The farther it is the easier it is.
1075	incorrect	Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.	Yes. Because when someone is going to ask her what data support what is she going to say.
4946	contradictory	When the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	It would have a lower pitch because it has less room to vibrate.
701	incorrect	Use a standard unit of mass like grams.	Maybe because the marbles are different sizes.
1567	correct	If the string is shorter, the pitch will be higher. If the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	The short string will be High and the long string will be low.
3812	incorrect	Shadows change during the day because the Earth is turning. The Sun stays in one place.	It will show where the light is falling to tell where the shadow will fall.
1809	incorrect	When less than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the greater the mass of beans harvested. When more than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the less the mass of beans harvested.	The green tells you that the relationship between the scoops of fertilizer and mass of beans harvest kilograms, is that they each go apart different.
4025	incorrect	As time increases, the speed of light stays the same (remains constant).	As time goes on the speed of light is longer.
1192	incorrect	Bill must have been using degrees Celsius if 28 is a warm temperature.	A thermometer.
3863	incorrect	The loops begin at opposite sides of the print.	The 2 loops is pointing in different directions.
4001	incorrect	The cotyledon provides food for the plant until the plant can make food for itself.	Holds the food.
257	correct	The contour lines are closest together at Q.	How do I know it is the steepest because the lines are closer.
488	correct	A solution was created when the eggshells disappeared (dissolved) and the mixture ended up as a clear liquid.	I think the reason why Grace thinks she made a solution is because the eggshells went away after awhile.
2762	incorrect	The elytra are used to make sounds.	It covers the wings.
3715	incorrect	The circuit does not include both contact points on the bulb holder, so the electricity can not go through the bulb.	It will not get light because the negative is getting to the motor.

1977	incorrect	You can not tell because we do not know the strength of the magnets. If the magnets are weak, the second piece of foam might put too much distance between the 2 magnets for the interaction to hold the magnets in place. If the magnets are strong the magnets might stay in place.	It depends on the power of the magnets.
2199	incorrect	All variables except the girl need to be held constant (controlled). The girls all need to throw the same ball and use the same launch technique.	Ling and Diana should change their experiments to a baseball because the baseball won.
4360	incorrect	The shorter the string is, the more the string swings in 15 seconds.  The longer the string is, the less the string swings in 15 seconds.	How fast the swinger is and how far it has to travel to complete one rotation.

3129	incorrect	Compare prints to see if the patterns are the same.	You look real hard to see that either their toes are separated or they have print on them.
130	contradictory	In the afternoon, shadows point east because the Sun is in the west. So the west side is opposite of the shadows.	I knew which direction west was because in the plaza it shows all the shadows facing one way and the sun makes shadows face the opposite directions of the object, and I knew that in the afternoon the sun is in the north so it must be west above.
2457	correct	The circuit is not complete. The electrical pathway is broken.	Because the line are not connected.
3478	incorrect	Darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors. The dark green sheeting is the darkest color available so she should use the green sheeting.	I chose that one because the sun might reflect it back and almost every dark color are the ones who makes it hot.
2256	contradictory	Different girls are throwing the balls. The girls use different launch techniques. Each girl uses a different type of ball.	Ran, stood, and walked 2 steps. Also the balls they used.
4119	correct	Water will always flow downhill (mountain to valley).	It flows in that direction because the water is going high land to low land.

3121	correct	Compare prints to see if the patterns are the same.	If they look the same.
81	correct	Diva needs to know how much gas pure sugar produced in order to decide whether the cookies are pure sugar. Diva needs to make a controlled experiment.	Diva needed to test pure sugar because if she just tested Fruity Cream cookies, she would have no proof of them having less milliliters than pure sugar.
187	correct	A reaction was indicated by the bubbles of gas (a new material) being produced.	Because the eggshells bubbled then dissolved.
550	correct	Use a standard unit of measurement such as centimeters or meters.	They can use a metric tape.
3763	incorrect	Bubbling means a gas has formed. Gas is a new material. A new material indicates a reaction.	He knew because there are bubbles in the container.

2102	incorrect	There is a complete circuit connecting the motor to the D-cell battery.	It will happen because the switch moved so it turns off another thing.
1856	incorrect	The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.	The solid stays in the filter because the filter's holes are too small for the liquid to go through.
3103	correct	The solid dissolves (seems to disappear) and the liquid remains clear.	The solid disappears into air pockets.
3965	correct	40 meters. The change in elevation is 20 meters between A and B and 20 meters between B and C. So the change between A and C is 40 meters. 20 m plus 20 m equals 40 m.	40 meters, I know because the contour line is 20. So since A and B is 20 add 20 more.
4363	correct	The shorter the string is, the more the string swings in 15 seconds.  The longer the string is, the less the string swings in 15 seconds.	The shorter it is it swings more, and the longer it is it swings less.

3725	incorrect	The circuit does not include both contact points on the bulb holder, so the electricity can not go through the bulb.	Because, the electricity goes through the wrong way the second time.
766	incorrect	X. When equal amounts of 2 solutions are compared, the solution that is more concentrated will have the greater mass (weigh more). 50 milliliters of X has a greater mass than 50 milliliters of Y, so X must be more concentrated.	X, because it is heavier.
2122	incorrect	A chemical reaction occurred. [The white solid is a precipitate (a new material) which indicates the reaction.]	It creates a precipitate a new chemical who you mix 2 different chemicals and that creates a precipitate.
4539	contradictory	A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.	A. Water is a heat sink and will heat up slow but there is no water in dry soil so it heats up fast.
3771	incorrect	Bubbling means a gas has formed. Gas is a new material. A new material indicates a reaction.	Because it bubbled and when something bubbled it means a reaction occurred.
4883	correct	Both finger patterns are loops.	It is the same because it has loops.
4368	correct	The shorter the string is, the more the string swings in 15 seconds.  The longer the string is, the less the string swings in 15 seconds.	I smaller the string the more amount of numbers.

3146	correct	Compare prints to see if the patterns are the same.	You could scan both pieces of paper and look at the ridges and grooves in the prints.
1749	contradictory	The bulb will light.	If she moves the switch left the motor will not start and the light will not light up.
3718	correct	The circuit does not include both contact points on the bulb holder, so the electricity can not go through the bulb.	The bulb will not light because one of the wires have to touch the other clip.
3180	correct	During a flood there is more water in the creek and the water flows faster.	The water goes out of its channel. The water speeds up.
4487	correct	The root grows first so the root can take up water for the plant.	Because it has to get the food and water.
2360	incorrect	If the key sticks, the key is iron; if the key does not stick the key is aluminum.	You would find the answer.
2135	correct	A chemical reaction occurred. [The white solid is a precipitate (a new material) which indicates the reaction.]	A chemical reaction.
1441	correct	Rub the minerals together and see which one scratches the other.	She can scratch them together and the one with the mark is the soft one.

888	incorrect	When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.	Uncovered versus covered would not help but both of each would.
4763	incorrect	The crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals.	Because it looks the same as her observation.
582	contradictory	The motor will continue to run because the motor still has a pathway to the D-cell.	If the bulb shuts off the motor will turn off because it is a series circuit.
1420	incorrect	There is a complete circuit connecting the bulb to the D-cell battery.	I think that because it is able to do that.
3056	incorrect	A standard is used for comparison to determine how changing one variable changes the results.	You use a standard to control your procedure, like if you get it wrong you can see what you did.
510	correct	The saxophone has the longest and fattest tube.	Because the sound has more room to vibrate.
2059	contradictory	The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.	It is greater than because they have the same amount of water but 5 has one more spoon than 4.
3710	correct	Fabric A is smoother and has a finer texture. Fabric B is rougher and has a coarser texture.	A was probably a much smoother fabric than B. Because B probably had more creases in it.
719	incorrect	In the morning the Sun is in the east so shadows point west. In the afternoon the Sun is in the west so shadows point east.	Because the time changes so the shadow is at the opposite.
4520	incorrect	A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.	A. The graph helped me by showing the temperature. The dry soil is darker with no heat sink material like water to slow the absorption of heat.
3954	incorrect	40 meters. The change in elevation is 20 meters between A and B and 20 meters between B and C. So the change between A and C is 40 meters. 20 m plus 20 m equals 40 m.	Feet, because it has a great space between.
4163	correct	The water was evaporated, leaving the salt.	By putting water in a Petri dish and letting the water evaporate.
3414	correct	An experiment is controlled if only one variable is changed at a time.	Only one variable is changed at a time.

1107	incorrect	Seeing multiple colors would show that vinegar can separate the permanent ink.	By looking at the vinegar.
4092	incorrect	The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.	The salt got dissolved in the water.
244	correct	A. The water in Julie's heater got hotter faster (or had a greater temperature change in 20 minutes). The collector in heater A has the greater surface area so the water in A would get hotter faster than the water in B.	A. Because she had higher temperatures than David.
3581	correct	The rubber band vibrates.	Because of the vibration.
771	incorrect	X. When equal amounts of 2 solutions are compared, the solution that is more concentrated will have the greater mass (weigh more). 50 milliliters of X has a greater mass than 50 milliliters of Y, so X must be more concentrated.	X, Cup x must have been more concentrated because it is heavier.
4420	incorrect	Fruitsnap contains little or no vitamin C so Fruitsnap does not change the color of the indophenol.	Probably because the Fruitsnap does not have very much concentrate.
1938	correct	If the middle bulb burns out the other 2 bulbs will stay lit.	They will stay lit.
1508	contradictory	The motor will run.	It will turn off.
426	incorrect	Earth materials erode and are carried by flowing water (a river). The earth materials form a delta when the materials are dropped off or deposited when the water stops flowing (at the mouth of a river).	Like a small river getting big, deltas are formed when a regular river is out to a ocean or lake. Over time the water will erode the mouth into a fan shaped deposit.
4523	correct	A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.	A. The graph helped me decide which container had the dry soil because I know that water is a heat sink and I know that heat sinks bring in heat slower and lets it out slow.
340	correct	Greta and Andre have different sized hands.	Because one of their hands are different sizes.
2857	incorrect	Put acid on a rock. If the acid fizzes, Phil would know that the rock has calcite.	Put the calcite in the vinegar and you will see bubbles.
117	incorrect	In the afternoon, shadows point east because the Sun is in the west. So the west side is opposite of the shadows.	I followed where I walk and it came to me and I found all the sides.

604	correct	When the string was tighter, the pitch was higher.	If the strings were tightened it would make a high sound.
2560	correct	The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.	Because it is a parallel circuit.
4571	correct	The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.	Clay is lighter than sand or pebbles so it would be easier for water to carry it farther.
4500	incorrect	The root grows first so the root can take up water for the plant.	So it can soak up food.
3574	correct	The rubber band vibrates.	It is vibrating.
818	incorrect	A solution is a mixture formed when a solid dissolves in a liquid.	You can see through it.
401	correct	If a part of the plant contains seeds, that part is the fruit.	It has to have an embryo, seed count, and cotyledon.
531	incorrect	Use a standard unit of measurement such as centimeters or meters.	The rug was 12.
1952	correct	If the middle bulb burns out the other 2 bulbs will stay lit.	If one goes out then the 2 will stay on.
2947	incorrect	If gas (carbon dioxide) is produced, the food contains acid. If no gas is produced, the food does not contain acid.	If the vinegar made the baking soda react it would shoot carbon dioxide into the pusher, then she needs to write down how many milliliters of carbon dioxide there is.
381	incorrect	The crystals have different shapes. Salt crystals are square with little Xs. The calcite crystals are shaped like needles (long and skinny).	Salt crystals had Xs and the crystals did not.
647	correct	Solar water heaters with blue collectors heat up faster than solar water heaters with red collectors.	That the blue will heat up faster than the red because the blue is darker.
163	incorrect	No, Fruity cream cookies are not pure sugar. The cookies did not produce as much gas as was produced by the pure sugar.	No, because on the top it has the name of the cookies and it shows how much sugar it has in it.
3169	incorrect	During a flood there is more water in the creek and the water flows faster.	It will flow faster and might swerve off track.
1088	contradictory	Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.	No. The data will not support her answer because all it says are the materials and what she is going to do.
3756	correct	Bubbling means a gas has formed. Gas is a new material. A new material indicates a reaction.	Because it started to bubble or to fizz and it is the proof of gas.
3877	incorrect	The loops begin at opposite sides of the print.	One is going left and the same.
1034	correct	The marbles used by the 2 groups were probably different masses.	I think the marbles had a different weight.
3563	contradictory	The rubber band vibrates.	Because your finger smacks on it.
3117	incorrect	Compare prints to see if the patterns are the same.	Some dogs more cracks on their paws.
2662	incorrect	You can see how much time is taken for the earth materials to move.	What the who form.
972	incorrect	The brass ring would not stick to the nail because the ring is not iron. The nail is a temporary magnet, but brass cannot become a temporary magnet and thus does not stick to magnets.	It will not stick to the nail because of the brass ring is not made of metal.
3144	incorrect	Compare prints to see if the patterns are the same.	You would be able to try the print.
4411	correct	Fruitsnap contains little or no vitamin C so Fruitsnap does not change the color of the indophenol.	The indophenol did not change color with Fruitsnap because there was none or very little vitamin C.
1419	incorrect	There is a complete circuit connecting the bulb to the D-cell battery.	Because it could not be a parallel circuit.
597	incorrect	The motor will continue to run because the motor still has a pathway to the D-cell.	Nothing will happen.
2020	incorrect	If the effort is applied farther from the fulcrum, less effort will lift the load.	When the effort gets farther away from the load the weight of the effort decreases.
3626	incorrect	The rubber band vibrates.	It makes the sound softer.
1014	incorrect	The sand particles are larger and settle first. The flour particles are smaller and therefore settle more slowly.	They separate because the water made them into layers. That is why they separated.
179	correct	A reaction was indicated by the bubbles of gas (a new material) being produced.	She made a reaction because bubbles appeared.
3196	contradictory	Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.	No, they do not because Richard put more water which will make it less concentrated.
3701	incorrect	Fabric A is smoother and has a finer texture. Fabric B is rougher and has a coarser texture.	The fabrics in A show that the fabrics is not show up fabrics and B it tells you that it was bumpy.
4777	incorrect	The crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals.	Alum looks exactly a like it in the dish.
1391	incorrect	There is a complete circuit connecting the bulb to the D-cell battery.	Because the battery is hooked to the switch that why.
4162	incorrect	The water was evaporated, leaving the salt.	By the Petri dish.
2320	contradictory	No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.	She can do it but it would have to be a parallel circuit.
645	correct	Solar water heaters with blue collectors heat up faster than solar water heaters with red collectors.	Blue is more darker so it absorbs more heat and that is why it is bigger.
421	correct	If a part of the plant contains seeds, that part is the fruit.	It nest to have a seed.
2811	contradictory	A heat sink is any material that absorbs (a lot of) heat.	A heat sink is an earth material that absorbs energy slowly and releases it slowly.
4893	correct	Both finger patterns are loops.	They are both loops.
4020	incorrect	As time increases, the speed of light stays the same (remains constant).	It is going on in seconds.
1408	correct	There is a complete circuit connecting the bulb to the D-cell battery.	It will happen because the switch is channeling the electricity to the light bulb.
3142	incorrect	Compare prints to see if the patterns are the same.	They have the same curves and shapes.
3006	correct	The food contains sugar.	The she tested sugar and it also indicates that the water was too hot.
4116	incorrect	Water will always flow downhill (mountain to valley).	Because rivers sometimes end in valleys.
3173	incorrect	During a flood there is more water in the creek and the water flows faster.	When there is a flood the water flow is much faster. It is also stronger.
2939	incorrect	The mirror would complete the image of the object and make the object appear whole.	You would see the object. But the object looks like it was flipped.
1667	incorrect	If the motor runs, the object is a conductor.	He will know because the energy will flow in a circle and there will be a open circuit.
963	contradictory	The brass ring would not stick to the nail because the ring is not iron. The nail is a temporary magnet, but brass cannot become a temporary magnet and thus does not stick to magnets.	It would not stick because there is no magnet involved.
1566	correct	If the string is shorter, the pitch will be higher. If the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	The short string has a higher pitch. The longer string has a lower pitch.
3809	incorrect	Shadows change during the day because the Earth is turning. The Sun stays in one place.	The shadow in the morning is long and the sun is pointing south when it is in the morning and it in the afternoon it is start the shadow.
4003	incorrect	As time increases, the speed of light stays the same (remains constant).	How long it takes to get to the speed of light.
4551	contradictory	The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.	It is heavy so I thought it would drop off quick.
3536	incorrect	The seed coat protects the seed until the plant begins to grow.	Seed coat cracks.
1535	incorrect	If the string is shorter, the pitch will be higher. If the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	If you pluck it make a volume.
1517	correct	The motor will run.	The motor and light goes on.
4787	incorrect	The crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals.	Because the picture matches.
3226	contradictory	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Nathaniel - Because it is harder than made of plastic.
1582	correct	The tree blocks the light from the Sun.	There is a shadow there because the sun is behind it and light cannot go through solid objects. Note, I think that question was kind of dumb.
789	correct	No, string is an insulator, so the pathway would not be completed.	No because a piece of string is not a conductor.
702	correct	Use a standard unit of mass like grams.	Use grams, use standard.
3723	incorrect	The circuit does not include both contact points on the bulb holder, so the electricity can not go through the bulb.	Because the bulb will not have enough energy because of the light bulb.
4530	incorrect	A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.	A. Because it heats up faster.
2636	correct	The mixtures are all clear.	When the solid material is disappeared.
2583	incorrect	The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.	The electricity will still flow through the wires to get to the other lights.
1359	correct	You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.	In a single fixed gravity creates a directional advantage. But in this one gravity pulls against you when pulling up.
4241	incorrect	Anna should compare the size of the grease spots. The sample with the larger grease spot has more fat.	On your indicator whichever had more grease spots.
4141	incorrect	Water will always flow downhill (mountain to valley).	I think the water flows in that direction because water cannot flow up a mountain.
2447	correct	The circuit is not complete. The electrical pathway is broken.	It is not in a circle.
459	incorrect	Earth materials erode and are carried by flowing water (a river). The earth materials form a delta when the materials are dropped off or deposited when the water stops flowing (at the mouth of a river).	Deltas form by water running over it.
1149	contradictory	Yes, aluminum foil is a metal and all metals conduct. The aluminum foil would complete the circuit.	Yes and no it has to have iron in it.
4805	correct	The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.	The relationship is that the less blocks the toy truck has the more it will carry and the more blocks the less it can carry.
3264	incorrect	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Sammy - I think that it would be easier to to tell apart plastic metal, and wood because metal makes a metallic sound plastic makes a clicky sound and wood blocks make a bangy sound.
4469	incorrect	The root grows first so the root can take up water for the plant.	Because they need roots to produce the leaves.
3446	contradictory	The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.	More? Because they are not facing at the same direction the Y is facing right and the X is facing left.
467	incorrect	A solution was created when the eggshells disappeared (dissolved) and the mixture ended up as a clear liquid.	That is because a solution is clear that you could see through.
464	incorrect	A solution was created when the eggshells disappeared (dissolved) and the mixture ended up as a clear liquid.	I think she did a solution because it had bubbles.
1981	contradictory	You can not tell because we do not know the strength of the magnets. If the magnets are weak, the second piece of foam might put too much distance between the 2 magnets for the interaction to hold the magnets in place. If the magnets are strong the magnets might stay in place.	I choose that answer because in the picture the magnets look like they will fall to the ground but the magnets are still connected. So I think the magnets will fall.
4409	correct	Fruitsnap contains little or no vitamin C so Fruitsnap does not change the color of the indophenol.	The fruit snap did not have vitamin C.
1184	contradictory	Bill must have been using degrees Celsius if 28 is a warm temperature.	28 F.
1173	incorrect	Yes, aluminum foil is a metal and all metals conduct. The aluminum foil would complete the circuit.	Yes because aluminum foil is a conductor.

3460	correct	The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.	I think it would be the same because there is no change in variables.
1363	incorrect	You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.	Single fixed pulley system a smaller effort and only one mechanical advantage.
4840	correct	When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.	It was able to pick up all the rest because the magnetism flow through the paperclips.
249	incorrect	The contour lines are closest together at Q.	As the contour lines get closer the mountain side gets steeper.
2023	contradictory	If the effort is applied farther from the fulcrum, less effort will lift the load.	The further the fulcrum lever is, closer it is the less it weighs.
2889	incorrect	A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.	The erosion will happen faster because the flow of the water is stronger and faster so the material will be worn down more.
1595	incorrect	The tree blocks the light from the Sun.	Because it is an object and it covers part of the sun's brightness.
955	incorrect	Water heats up faster when covered.	It will kept on raising and raising.

4364	correct	The shorter the string is, the more the string swings in 15 seconds.  The longer the string is, the less the string swings in 15 seconds.	The longer the swinging string is the less times it will swing and when it is a smaller string it goes faster.
3634	incorrect	The rubber band vibrates.	Because you can make you hand is hurt.
4711	correct	The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.	Because there is 2 spoons and 50 milliliters and then there is 4 spoons and 100 milliliters so they are going to weigh the same.
2879	incorrect	A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.	The water pressure will be harder, so if that happens it will create a bigger canyon and delta. Erosion.
1111	incorrect	Seeing multiple colors would show that vinegar can separate the permanent ink.	It is not the same.
996	incorrect	The brass ring would not stick to the nail because the ring is not iron. The nail is a temporary magnet, but brass cannot become a temporary magnet and thus does not stick to magnets.	It will not stick to it.

4630	correct	C. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. Pan C has the most dark surface area so C would heat up the fastest and have the highest temperature.	C. It has more black disks to absorb more heat.
2004	contradictory	You can not tell because we do not know the strength of the magnets. If the magnets are weak, the second piece of foam might put too much distance between the 2 magnets for the interaction to hold the magnets in place. If the magnets are strong the magnets might stay in place.	Because here I tried this with my reading book and it is thinner or it did not stick.
1268	contradictory	20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.	Because I looked at 10 centimeters and looked at 10 minutes and then I thought what was half of 3 and that is how I got my answer.

1473	incorrect	Emily's crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals shown on the key.	I looked at the pictures and words and I tried to see which one matched the crystals in the circle.
3934	incorrect	40 meters. The change in elevation is 20 meters between A and B and 20 meters between B and C. So the change between A and C is 40 meters. 20 m plus 20 m equals 40 m.	Because it is the its spread apart.
4002	correct	As time increases, the speed of light stays the same (remains constant).	This graph tells me that the speed never changes.
160	correct	No, Fruity cream cookies are not pure sugar. The cookies did not produce as much gas as was produced by the pure sugar.	No, because they have less carbon dioxide than pure sugar.
1811	incorrect	When less than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the greater the mass of beans harvested. When more than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the less the mass of beans harvested.	That the mass of the beans it got higher but the more heavier it got it went down.
3355	correct	There is 30 grams (20 grams plus 10 grams) in the right cup. The balance is tipped down on the ball side which means the ball weighs more than 30 grams. 40 grams is the only weight heavier than 30 grams.	20 plus 10 equals 30 and that is smaller than the ball which must be C.
1480	incorrect	Emily's crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals shown on the key.	Because they look like they have the same properties.
1767	incorrect	The harder mineral will leave a scratch on the less hard mineral. If the black mineral is harder, the brown mineral will have a scratch.	Scratch test.

4648	correct	Overly Orange takes fewer drops to change the color of indophenol so Overly Orange has a higher concentration of vitamin C.	Overly Orange, OO, has more because it has less drops. Luscious Lemon does not have as much as OO because of the drops.
2577	incorrect	The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.	The magnetic force will still go through.
3345	correct	There is 30 grams (20 grams plus 10 grams) in the right cup. The balance is tipped down on the ball side which means the ball weighs more than 30 grams. 40 grams is the only weight heavier than 30 grams.	I chose it because there is a 20 grams piece and a 10 grams piece but the ball is not even with the other side so it must weigh more.
4370	correct	The shorter the string is, the more the string swings in 15 seconds.  The longer the string is, the less the string swings in 15 seconds.	If the string is smaller it swings more times if it is longer it swings less times.
2700	correct	So that people notice the sound.	So everyone can hear it.
212	correct	A reaction was indicated by the bubbles of gas (a new material) being produced.	It bubbled that is why.
2164	correct	The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.	Both of the motors are hooked up to the positive wire, in order for it to work one has to be hooked to a positive and the other has to be hooked up to a negative.
1283	incorrect	Set up evaporation dishes. The water will go into the air (evaporate) and the solid will be left in the dish (crystallize).	He could use a paper filter decided what he is using or a screen.
4465	incorrect	Measure out equal masses of walnuts and peanuts. Smash the samples uniformly in the same size area on brown paper. Wait the same time for each sample.	Anna should make sure one is not salted and one is not.
4843	incorrect	When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.	Well it can do that because the florescent is flowing through all of the paperclips, that is why.
752	incorrect	X. When equal amounts of 2 solutions are compared, the solution that is more concentrated will have the greater mass (weigh more). 50 milliliters of X has a greater mass than 50 milliliters of Y, so X must be more concentrated.	X, cup x is more heavier.
3339	incorrect	There is 30 grams (20 grams plus 10 grams) in the right cup. The balance is tipped down on the ball side which means the ball weighs more than 30 grams. 40 grams is the only weight heavier than 30 grams.	I think that is the answer 20 plus 10 equals 30.
2101	incorrect	There is a complete circuit connecting the motor to the D-cell battery.	The switch will be off.
3411	correct	An experiment is controlled if only one variable is changed at a time.	Changing one variable at a time.
1571	contradictory	If the string is shorter, the pitch will be higher. If the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	Because the short one has more air so when you hit it it bring a low sound.
3572	correct	The rubber band vibrates.	Because it vibrates.
1761	correct	The harder mineral will leave a scratch on the less hard mineral. If the black mineral is harder, the brown mineral will have a scratch.	One will scratch the other one. She should rub the scratch, too. That way she knows if it is a scratch or dust from the other mineral.
3970	correct	The cotyledon provides food for the plant until the plant can make food for itself.	Gives the seed food.
155	incorrect	No, Fruity cream cookies are not pure sugar. The cookies did not produce as much gas as was produced by the pure sugar.	Finally Cream cookies are not pure sugar I know that because.
1007	contradictory	The sand particles are larger and settle first. The flour particles are smaller and therefore settle more slowly.	The sand and flour separate because the sand is heavier than the flour, so the flour goes to the top and the sand sinks.

1011	contradictory	The sand particles are larger and settle first. The flour particles are smaller and therefore settle more slowly.	I think the sand is on the bottom because it is heavy and the flour is in the water because it is smaller and does not weigh a lot.
3941	contradictory	40 meters. The change in elevation is 20 meters between A and B and 20 meters between B and C. So the change between A and C is 40 meters. 20 m plus 20 m equals 40 m.	360, big the line of the A, B, C, D.
2949	correct	If gas (carbon dioxide) is produced, the food contains acid. If no gas is produced, the food does not contain acid.	If the syringe went up at all, that means the food contains acid. We already know that the food contains sugar because it fizzed.
767	incorrect	X. When equal amounts of 2 solutions are compared, the solution that is more concentrated will have the greater mass (weigh more). 50 milliliters of X has a greater mass than 50 milliliters of Y, so X must be more concentrated.	X, Because cup x is more heavier!
201	incorrect	A reaction was indicated by the bubbles of gas (a new material) being produced.	Because she put eggshells in a cup and covered them with vinegar and after a couple of days she saw that they were gone.
4707	incorrect	The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.	All solutions are mixtures, and a solution is when something disappears into the other.
329	correct	Greta and Andre have different sized hands.	Maybe because one of their hands are bigger one of their hands are smaller.
4205	incorrect	Many tiny bubbles will rise from the calcite when the calcite contacts the cold acid.	For bubbles.

2112	correct	There is a complete circuit connecting the motor to the D-cell battery.	That is one circuit.
4503	correct	The root grows first so the root can take up water for the plant.	It has to suck up all the water so that it can grow.
1579	incorrect	The tree blocks the light from the Sun.	If it show on south east the shadow will be facing north east.
203	incorrect	A reaction was indicated by the bubbles of gas (a new material) being produced.	Because the egg shells disappeared.
4760	correct	The crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals.	They have the same shape.
2044	contradictory	If the effort is applied farther from the fulcrum, less effort will lift the load.	It takes more effort the farther away the load is from the fulcrum.
4064	incorrect	The crystals were square with Xs on the surface.	I would know that the crystals were salt is the way how it looks.
1023	incorrect	The sand particles are larger and settle first. The flour particles are smaller and therefore settle more slowly.	If you put the sand then the flour then the gray materials then the water the gray materials speeds the sand and the flour.
4220	correct	Anna should compare the size of the grease spots. The sample with the larger grease spot has more fat.	She can tell by how big each grease spot is so if walnuts had more fat it would have a bigger grease spot.
1146	incorrect	Yes, aluminum foil is a metal and all metals conduct. The aluminum foil would complete the circuit.	Yes because that object can hold electricity throughout.
3297	incorrect	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	Sammy - Because it is all kinds of stuff and Nathaniel is all wood it is hard to tell.
2458	correct	The circuit is not complete. The electrical pathway is broken.	There is an open circuit.
3843	incorrect	So people know exactly what the measurement means. A standard is necessary so everyone measures using the same unit and everyone gets the same measurement.	Because if you had no standard of measurement you could not measure anything.
3856	incorrect	So people know exactly what the measurement means. A standard is necessary so everyone measures using the same unit and everyone gets the same measurement.	So that you can make an exact and accurate measurement.
1587	incorrect	The tree blocks the light from the Sun.	The sun goes over us and we go around.
1864	incorrect	The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.	Because the solid did not dissolve.
2730	incorrect	The elytra are used to make sounds.	Another function is to protect.
2289	correct	The fizzing indicates a gas, a new material, is produced. When a new material is produced, a chemical reaction has occurred.	Fizzing evidence of a chemical reaction because when it fizzes it means it is producing gas.
2800	contradictory	A heat sink is any material that absorbs (a lot of) heat.	It is when the sun absorbs the water from the sand.
4267	incorrect	Crystals of different materials have different shapes. So the shape will help identify the material.	He can mate the crystals to the solid material.
897	correct	When the string was shorter, the pitch was higher.	It got a higher pitch.
4821	correct	The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.	The relationship is that each time he add a block it goes about one meter lower.
2791	incorrect	Like poles repel and opposite poles attract.	The rings do not attach each other because they are flipped upside down.
2287	correct	The fizzing indicates a gas, a new material, is produced. When a new material is produced, a chemical reaction has occurred.	Because when it fizzes there is gas and that is a sign of a chemical reaction.
110	incorrect	In the afternoon, shadows point east because the Sun is in the west. So the west side is opposite of the shadows.	I just looked at it if it was early afternoon it would be pointing northeast and if it was late afternoon it would be point to southwest.
1764	correct	The harder mineral will leave a scratch on the less hard mineral. If the black mineral is harder, the brown mineral will have a scratch.	The one with scratches or deeper scratches is weaker and the other rock is harder.
1835	correct	The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.	The holes in the filter are smaller than the solid particles, and the water particles are smaller than the holes, so the water goes through the filter while the solid will not go through.
2530	correct	Topaz would be the hardest of the 4 minerals because none of the tools could scratch topaz and at least one tool could scratch each of the other minerals.	Topaz is the hardest out of all minerals because it did not get scratched by any tool.
60	incorrect	Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.	The fizzing means that it came from the gas.
1666	correct	If the motor runs, the object is a conductor.	It will run or turn on if it is a conductor.
2734	incorrect	The elytra are used to make sounds.	Their soft body.
2684	incorrect	You can see how much time is taken for the earth materials to move.	What you get from the logs are the times.
4461	incorrect	Measure out equal masses of walnuts and peanuts. Smash the samples uniformly in the same size area on brown paper. Wait the same time for each sample.	First take one gram or milligram and take a brown paper indicator and put it on a scale and when the food is one gram put it aside for 2 days and then see which one has the most grease.
1558	correct	If the string is shorter, the pitch will be higher. If the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	The sound of a short string is like a ding a long string sounds like a dong.
2941	incorrect	If gas (carbon dioxide) is produced, the food contains acid. If no gas is produced, the food does not contain acid.	The results tell her that acid is present.
1877	correct	A car is made of a lot of iron or steel.	The metal of the tire rim or under the car or the outside of the car except the windows. Only if the metal has iron.
3726	incorrect	The circuit does not include both contact points on the bulb holder, so the electricity can not go through the bulb.	There are 2 wires that should not be there the motor wires.
2794	incorrect	Like poles repel and opposite poles attract.	They are not touching each other because they repel.
2799	correct	A heat sink is any material that absorbs (a lot of) heat.	Heat sink is anything that gets or contains heat.
4517	contradictory	A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.	B. because A has the highest temperature and B has the lowest.
4301	incorrect	Wendy should hook one end of the wire to the negative side of a D-cell battery and the other end to the positive side of the D-cell battery.	Get a D-cell and a switch.
672	correct	Solar water heaters with blue collectors heat up faster than solar water heaters with red collectors.	Tells me that blue covered and uncovered is hotter than red cover and uncovered.
62	contradictory	Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.	No because they are different grams.
3773	incorrect	Bubbling means a gas has formed. Gas is a new material. A new material indicates a reaction.	I think it is because it started to bubble and because it would not do that if it was not a reaction.
2005	contradictory	You can not tell because we do not know the strength of the magnets. If the magnets are weak, the second piece of foam might put too much distance between the 2 magnets for the interaction to hold the magnets in place. If the magnets are strong the magnets might stay in place.	The magnets will not stick because 2 foam blocks have more space than one.
1712	incorrect	Jim would see a clear solution. 3 spoons of solid dissolves, so 2 spoons will dissolve.	That there is one dg. one spoon is 5 grams.
937	correct	Water heats up faster when covered.	It tells if you use a cover it gets hotter than not using a cover.
3519	contradictory	The seed coat protects the seed until the plant begins to grow.	To protect the seed when it is growing.
